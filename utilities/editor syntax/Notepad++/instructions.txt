Notepad++ syntax for viewing LST files with some coloring. Not really complete, but it is great starting point for anyone using Notepad++ to edit LST files. You will need to place it in "C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++" in VISTA, but I am not sure where to place it if you are using XP.
