		<h1>Game Rules Implementation Guide</h1>
		
		<p class="indent1">The Game Rules Implementation Guide provides a series of rules implementation explanations, 
		organized in two sections: The <a href="#PCGENDIST">PCGen Distributed Rules</a> and the 
		<a href="#HOMEBREW">Rules for Homebrews</a>. The exaples provided are not the only way to 
		implement the subject rules. They are given here simply as examples of how different rules 
		can be implemented.  For more general information on writing standard LST files please 
		visit the <a href="../lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">LST File Class</a> page.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><a href="../rulesguide/game_rules_reading_instructions.html">Instructions</a> 
		on how to read these pages can be found below.</p>

  		<h2>PCGen Distributed Rules</h2>

		<p class="indent1">This section includes those rules that have been implemented as part of the officially 
		distributed datasets from PCGen.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<dl class="indent1">
				<dt><a href="grig_negative_levels.html">Negative Levels</a></dt>
 					<dd>Equipment/Items can now bestow negative levels upon a character.</dd>
			</dl>
		</blockquote>

  		<h2>Rules for Homebrews</h2>

		<p class="indent1">This section includes rules implementation solutions aimed at homebrew datasets. As game 
		rules can have many different implementations within PCGen, you will find implementations 
		included below that address the same game rule. In these cases, each solution is presented on 
		its own page for clarity.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<dl class="indent1">
				<dt><a href="grig_abilities_by_skill_ranks.html">Buying Abilities with Skill Ranks</a></dt>
					<dd>Abilities may be bought by skill ranks taken in the appropriate skill.<br>
					by Andrew Maitland</dd>
				<dt><a href="grig_priesthoods1.html">Priesthoods #1</a></dt>
					<dd>Deities may have multiple priesthoods, each with their own powers and abilities.<br>
					by Maredudd</dd>
				<dt>Priesthoods #2 (forthcoming)</dt>
					<dd>An alternative way to implement Priesthoods.<br>
