	<h3>Specialized Wizard</h3>
    
	<p class="indent1">A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic but must select two other schools as his opposition schools.
	There are a couple of aspects of wizard specialization that PCGen does not handle at this time:</p>
    
	<p class="indent2"><br><em>A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his opposition schools, if any)</em></p>
	<p class="indent1">Currently PCGen will add all 0-level spells to a wizard's known spells, you must manually remove the opposition school spells to comply with this rule.</p>
    
	<p class="indent2"><br><em>A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell.</em></p>
	<p class="indent1">Currently PCGen cannot enforce this, you could add the spell twice to your prepared spells list to represent the two slots.</p>
    
	<h3>Ability descriptions</h3>	
	
	<p class="indent1">Paizo has allowed the use of the full text in the descriptions of abilities. For some abilities 
		this text can be quite long. In order to provide an option for those who don't want to have the full text filling 
		up their character sheet we are utilizing a feature that has not been use previously in the Open Source datasets. 
		The dataset can hold two versions of the description, a short description, which is usually the flavor text and an 
		optional long description or benefit text which can contain the full text of the ability description. To set this 
		option choose &quot;<a href="../../menupages/settings/settingspreferencesoption.html">Preferences</a>&quot; from 
		the Settings menu. Click on <a href="../../menupages/settings/appearance/appearancedisplay.html">Display Options 
		in the Appearance tree</a> and find the &quot;<a href="../../menupages/settings/appearance/appearancedisplay.html">Display 
		Feat Description</a>&quot; option. When this is checked the short description is output, when it is unchecked the 
		longer benefit text is displayed if there is such text available. If there is no benefit text the short description 
		will be used by default.</p>
	<p class="indent1">For those who wish to have a technical explanation of how this is done refer to the 
		<a href="../../listfilepages/datafilestagpages/datafilesability.html#BENEFIT">BENEFIT</a> tag. This 
		tag allows the data to contain two versions of ability descriptions, the 
		<a href="../../listfilepages/globalfilestagpages/globalfilesother.html#DESC">DESC</a> generally holds 
		a short version and <a href="../../listfilepages/datafilestagpages/datafilesability.html#BENEFIT">BENEFIT</a> 
		holds the longer version.</p>
