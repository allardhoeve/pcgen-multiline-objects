	<p class="indent1">A number of non-player characters from this source can be generated 
	  from kits included in the dataset. Create a new character and click the Add 
	  Kit/Create Monster button, in the list of kits you will find a set of kits which 
	  starts with &quot;NPC&quot; followed by the name of the character in parentheses. 
	  All the monsters introduced in this book can also be generated with a Default 
	  Monster Kit as well.</p>
	<p class="indent1">Some characters are unique creations and required custom templates 
	  to grant the abilities specified by the books authors. For example the character 
	  Koruvus is a goblin which has been mutated by the Waters of Lamashtu which made 
	  him medium size and give him the ability to spit acid among other abilities. 
	  To account for this a template was created named &quot;Waters of Lamashtu (Koruvus's 
	  Mutation)&quot; which if removed will restore the character to a more normal 
	  goblin (which is a possible outcome in the scenario).</p>
	<p class="indent1">Not all the NPC's are included because some were created using 
	  closed content and cannot be recreated in PCGen. </p>
