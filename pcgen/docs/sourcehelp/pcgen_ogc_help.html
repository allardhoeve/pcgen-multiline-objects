	<h3>Equipment Descriptions</h3>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Quiver:</strong> A light leather container with a strap 
	  made for carrying arrows or bolts. Groups of 20 bolts or arrows usually come 
	  in a quiver.</p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Sheath:</strong> A simple leather container with a strap 
	  made for carrying a single weapon; it can either be worn on a belt for one-handed type weapons or across the back for larger two-handed weapons. </p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Armor Padding:</strong> This item comes with the purchase 
	  of Full Plate armor.</p>
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Cap (Steel):</strong> This item comes with the purchase 
	  of a Chain Shirt.</p>
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Helmet (Visored):</strong> This item comes with the 
	  purchase of Full Plate armor.</p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Bracers of Armor +9 and +10:</strong> These items function 
	  exactly like other Bracers of Armor just at a +9 and +10 bonus. They are included 
	  here because the MagicItemsV.rtf document details Bracers from +1 to +8 and 
	  the Epic document details Bracers from +11 and higher. These two fill in the 
	  gap. </p>

	<h3>Starting Funds Kits</h3>
	
	<p class="indent1">These kits will randomly grant an amount of gold, adding it to the 
		&quot;Gold&quot; field on the <strong>Gear Tab</strong> which can then be spent 
		purchasing equipment. There are several kits corresponding to the typical dice 
		used for this purpose. The <strong>Starting Gold</strong> kits can be applied 
		as many times as you wish and they will continue to add more gold to your PC.</p>

	<p class="indent2">Starting Funds (1d4 times 10)</p>
	<p class="indent2">Starting Funds (2d4 times 10)</p>

	<h2><a name="pcgenogcpsicrystal">PCGen OGC - Psicrystal Hit Dice Data Set</a></h2>

	<p class="indent1"><strong>Game Mode: 35e</strong></p>
	
	<p>The PCGen Open Gaming Content - Psicrystal Hit Dice dataset is designed to 
  	modify Psicrystals in the RSRD Psionics dataset so that they gain hit dice as 
  	the Master progresses in class levels.</p>

	<p>The need for this originates from certain interpretations of the Psicrystal 
  	rules which hold that Psicrystals gain hit dice as the Master progresses in 
  	class levels and by extension also gain feats every 3 levels and stat bumps 
  	every 4. The dataset was not coded in this way and the designers apparently 
  	never intended this, however no errata has been published to refute or clarify 
  	this interpretation. This set is provided for those who wish to play Psicrystals 
  	under this interpretation.</p>
	
	<p>This set must be loaded with the RSRD Psionics set or the RSRD Complete set 
  	(which includes Psionics). When loaded it adds Hit Dice (Monster Class Levels) 
  	equal to the masters Psionic class levels. It also adds a point to the feat 
  	pool at first, third and every three levels after. Every four levels it grants 
  	a 1 point increase to an attribute of the user's choice.</p>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> An unmodified Psicrystal is granted Alertness as a virtual feat, this 
  	set disables that, Alertness must be purchased with a feat point if it is desired.</p>
	
	<h3>Additional Feature</h3>
	
	<p>The rules state that a Psicrystal has at least 4 Ranks in Spot, Listen, Move 
  	Silently, and Search even if its Master does not. PCGen cannot implement this 
  	automatically so 4 temporary bonuses can be activated manually by the user to 
  	bring the ranks of these skills up to 4 if the Master is lacking. They can be 
  	found in the Temporary Bonuses sub-tab of the Inventory Tab under templates. 
  	Each starts with the name &quot;Psicrystal Skills&quot; and allows you to set 
  	the Rank from 1 to 4.</p>

	<p class="indent1">The 80 Point Standard Campaign point-buy-method is provided as part of the default 
		gameMode folder and so is made available if the selected gameMode doesn't include a Point-Buy Method. 
		The 80 point system assumes initial stats are set to zero.</p>
