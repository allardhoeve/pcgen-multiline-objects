			as listing the main contributors. There are far too many contributors to list them all here since PCGen 
			is very much a community effort. Info on where to get new releases of PCGen and how to find the PCGen
			community is also provided. Clicking on either of the WWW site or the Email List links will take you 
			to the appropriate web sites that are listed within the button.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Code, List, Test</strong> and <strong>Engineering</strong> sub-tabs will display a list of the 
			contributors by their general Monkey Groupings.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Licensing</strong> tab displays the terms if the licenses used by the PCGen team in the production of PCGen and its data sets.</p>
