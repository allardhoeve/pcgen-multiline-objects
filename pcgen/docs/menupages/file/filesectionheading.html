		<h1>File Menu Options</h1>
		
		<p>These are the <strong>File</strong> menu options that are available to use once sources have 
			been loaded. These options are used for starting a new PC, loading an existing PC, or exporting 
			a currently loaded PC to a file.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_0.png" alt="File Menu Options"></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>New</strong> command allows the user to create a new PC based on the loaded sources. 
			The newly created PC appears on a new tab in the main window ready for the user to input the 
			information needed to build the PC.</p>

<!--
		<p>The <strong>New NPC</strong> command opens up a new window containing options for creating 
		random characters within a set of parameters you can specify.</p>
-->
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_0_open.png" alt="Open Existing PC"></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Open</strong> command prompts the user to pick an existing PC to load. The <strong>Open</strong> 
			window opens on the last place that the user selected to save a PC to and shows the available PCs.</p>

<hr>

		<p>The <strong>Close</strong> command closes the PC without exiting the application.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Close All </strong>command closes all loaded PCs without exiting the application. PCGen will 
			prompt the user for each PC to see if it needs to be saved.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_1_save.png" alt="File Menu Options"></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save</strong> command saves the active PC. If the character has been saved before, the PC will be 
			saved in the same location, and under the same name, as previously saved. If the PC has not been saved yet the 
			<strong>Save</strong> window will pop up with the PC's name already entered into the filename field. Click 
			the <strong>Save</strong> button and the PC will be saved. The default location to which the PC will be saved 
			is the &quot;Characters&quot; folder under the PCGen main directory but the user can navigate to any location 
			desired.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Save As</strong> command allows the user to save the PC under a new filename. The <strong>Save</strong> 
			window will pop up and ask for the name under which the PC will be saved. Enter the new name and click the 
			<strong>Save</strong> button. This will create a new file with the new name used and will not overwrite the 
			original file from which the PC was loaded.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save All</strong> command is used to save all the open PCs to their respective files and folders. 
			This is a quick way to save multiple loaded PCs at one time using the same names that they previously had before.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Revert to Saved</strong> command reverts all changes made to the character and takes the PC back to the 
			way it was when last loaded or saved.</p>

<hr>

		<p>The <a href="filepartyoptions.html"><strong>Party</strong></a> command opens a submenu that provides additional 
			options, allowing the user to save and open a collection of PCs as a group with a single command.</p>

<hr>

		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_4_print.png" alt="Character Printing"></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Print</strong> command sends the active PC to the printer using one of several files.
			<ul>
				<li>Once the option is selected the <strong>Print</strong> window appears and the user selects an 
					output sheet from the drop-down menu at the top of the window.</li>
				<li>Clicking the <strong>Print</strong> button will send the character to the printer.</li>
				<li>Clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> will exit from the print window.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Additional features available on the print window include the following:
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>Page</strong> drop-down on the lower-left side of the window will change the page showing in the window, 
					allowing the user to preview the character sheet.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Zoom</strong> field an drop-down allows the user to change the zoom level of the character sheet. Alternatively, 
					the <strong>Magnifying Glass</strong> buttons can be used to zoom in and out of the character sheet instead.</li>
				<li>Clicking and dragging the <strong>Lower Right</strong> corner of the print window will resize the window, providing a better 
					view of the character sheet.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_3_export.png" alt="File Menu Options"></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Export</strong> command exports the PC to a file used to view the PC.
			These are used primarily to view and use the PC with other applications such as 
			Internet Browsers, Adobe Acrobat, OpenRPG, and others.</p>

<hr>

		<p>Between the <strong>Export</strong> and the <strong>Exit</strong> commands you will find a list of the 
			most recently closed or saved characters. These are included here to allow convenient loading directly 
			from this menu.</p>

<hr>

		<p>The <strong>Exit </strong>command exits PCGen and prompts the user to save the
			character(s) before closing.</p>
