		<h1>Party Options</h1>
		
		<p>The <strong>Party</strong> command provides a number of options that make managing groups of PCs easier.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_party.png" alt="Party Options"></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Party</strong> command opens up a new set of options for the user to use.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_partyopen.png" alt="Opening a Party"></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Open Party</strong> option opens a party file from the last folder PCgen used to save a file in. 
			The <strong>Open</strong> window will pop up and the user can select the desired <strong>Party</strong> 
			file and click <strong>Open</strong>. Party files use the <span class=:lstfile">.pcp</span> file extension..</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Close Party</strong> option closes the party files, saving and unloading all PCs currently loaded.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_partysave.png" alt="Saving a Party"></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Save Party</strong> option allows the user to save all the PCs currently loaded as a &quot;party&quot;. 
			The <strong>Save</strong> window will pop up and prompt the user for the party name. Enter the party name and 
			click the <strong>Save</strong> button and PCGen will save the party. This in turn allows the user to quickly 
			load all PCs in the party. This is useful for a DM who manages the PCs in his campaign, allowing him to load 
			all PCs in the party with one file name.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Save Party As</strong> option allows the user to save the party under a new filename. This functions 
			much as the <strong>Save</strong> command does for PCs.</p>

<hr>

		<p>Below the <strong>Save Party</strong> commands you will find a list of the most recently closed or saved 
			parties. These are included here to allow convenient loading directly from this menu.</p>
