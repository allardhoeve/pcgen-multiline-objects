		<h1>Classes Tab</h1>
		
		<p>The <strong>Class</strong> tab is where you add class levels to your characters.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/classestab/tab_classes_00.png" alt="Main Tab: Classes" /></p>
		
		<p>The left pane displays the full list of classes available from the loaded data sets. Besides PC classes, 
			this list also includes all NPC and Creature classes. Clicking on the <strong>Qualified</strong> button 
			will remove all classes that have requirements that the current character does not meet. An example of 
			this would be a class with an alignment requirement, such as the <strong>Paladin</strong> which requires 
			that the character be &quot;Lawful Good&quot;. Finally, you can use the <strong>Search</strong> field to 
			find the class you are looking for.</p>

		<p>The right pane is where the character's classes appear as they are added. All classes previously 
			selected, from this tab or from the <strong>Summary</strong> tab, will already be listed here. In 
			this case, if you continue and select another class, either the same of a new class, the newly selected 
			class will be added to the list.</p>

		<p>The lower pane is the <strong>Class Info</strong> pane. When you select a class in the left or right pane 
			this pane will display the basic information for the selected class.</p>

		<p>Selecting a class is a simple process. Find and click on the desired class in the left pane and then click 
			on the <strong>Add Level(s) &gt;</strong> button. The class appears in the right pane, at the bottom of 
			the list, and you are done.</p>

		<p>If you wish to remove a class level you click on the <strong>&lt; Remove Level</strong> button. The last 
			class added will be removed from the the character and from the right pane.</p>
