		<h1>Feats and Abilities Tab</h1>
		
		<p>This is the <strong>Feats and Abilities</strong> tab. Here the user will choose which feats and 
			abilities, to add to the character.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/featandabilitiestab/tab_featsandabilities_00_feats.png" alt="Main Tab: Feats" /></p>

		<p>The <strong>Feats and Abilities</strong> tab has a number of additional subtabs, starting with the <strong>Feats</strong> 
			subtab. These subtabs, each representing a different category of abilities, will depend on the data sets loaded. 
			Examples of some other categories of abilities you will see in PCGen's distributed data sets include <strong>Racial 
			Abilities</strong>, <strong>Racial Traits</strong>, <strong>Class Abilities</strong>, and many more, and all panes 
			have the same four panes.</p>

		<p>Next to the word &quot;Available&quot; is a selection box that lets the user pick which &quot;view&quot; to use. 
			It is this view, which will be used to determine the structure of the table below it. The same is true for the
			&quot;Selected&quot; feats, which list the feats already selected for the PC.</p>

		<p>By default the feats and abilities for the PC selected as optional feats and abilities are will show in black text 
			in the  table. Feats and abilities gained <strong>automatically</strong> (due to a race or class ability or trait) 
			are displayed in dark-yellow text. Feats and abilities gained <strong>virtually</strong> (typically this means 
			there's some restriction on them) are displayed in magenta text. <strong>Virtual</strong> or <strong>Automatic</strong> 
			feats and abilities cannot be removed. Nor can the selections of <strong>Virtual</strong> or <strong>Automatic</strong> 
			feats and abilities be changed.</p>
		
		<p>To add a feat or ability to your character you click on it and then you click on the <strong>Add Selected &gt;</strong> 
			button. You can also add an the desired item by double-clicking on it. Similarly, to remove a feat or ability, or to 
			alter the internal selections of feats and abilities with such options, e.g. <strong>Weapon Focus (Longsword)</strong>, 
			you double-clicking on it in the right pane. You can also select it in the right pane and then clicking on the 
			<strong>&lt; Remove Selected</strong> beneath the pane. As elsewhere in PCGen anything that is not qualified for is 
			in red italics.</p>
		
		<p>The info-pane in the bottom-right pane will display details about any feat clicked upon, including any prerequisites 
			and its source.</p>
