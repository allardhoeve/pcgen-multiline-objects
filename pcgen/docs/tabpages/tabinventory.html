		<h1>Inventory Tab</h1>
		
		<p>The Inventory tab is where you purchase &amp; equip items that your character possesses. It is made up of two sub-tabs: </p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong><a href="#purchase">Purchase</a></strong> - Purchasing and selling equipment</li>
			<li><strong><a href="#equipment">Equipment</a></strong> - Organizing the items you own into equipment sets. Determining which weapons and armor are 
				used and in what hands</li>
		</ul>

<hr>

		<h2><a name="purchase">Purchase Sub-Tab</a></h2>
		
		<p>This sub-tab allows the purchasing and selling of equipment including armor, shields, weapons, and other equipment of all types.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_00_purchase.png" alt="Inventory Purchase Sub-Tab" /></p>
		
		<p>The left pane includes items that can be bought or customized while the right pane shows the items already purchased or owned.</p>
 
		<p>Items in the left pane that appear in red are items that the character does not have proficiency in. These items may be removed 
			from the list by clicking on the <strong>Qualified</strong> button. Clicking on the <strong>Affordable</strong> button will 
			further reduce the list of items, removing items that the current character cannot afford. This will be done even if the Buy/Sell 
			Rate is changed to &quot;Cashless - Buy 0 Sell 0&quot;</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_00_search.png" alt="Item Search" /></p>

		<p>The list of items in the left pane is long but can be shorted by entering the name of the piece of equipment being 
			sought. The list of available equipment will change as the items name is entered, narrowing the list of equipment 
			as you go.</p>

		<p>Items can be purchased by:
			<ul>
				<li>Selecting the item in the left frame and then clicking the <strong>Add Equipment &gt;</strong> button</li>
				<li>Double Clicking the item in the left frame</li>
				<li>Right clicking the item in the left frame and buying 1, 5, 10, 20 or n (user entered quantity) at a time</li>
			</ul>
		</p>		

		<p>Items can be sold by:
			<ul>
				<li>Selecting the item in the right frame and then clicking the <strong>&lt; Remove Equipment</strong> button</li>
				<li>Double Clicking the item in the right frame</li>
				<li>Right clicking the item in the right frame and selling 1, 5, 10, 20 or n (user entered quantity) at a time</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>If you right-click any of the items there you will get a drop-down menu of options available for that item, 
			including the following:
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>Move Item To</strong> option provides a list of all characters currently loaded and then moves the item to the character selected.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Copy Item To</strong> option provides a list of all characters currently loaded and then moves a copy of the item to the character selected.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Modify Charges</strong> option allows you to modify the number of charges left on a charged item, e.g. magic wand or staff.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>As you purchase or sell items you will see the amount of money you have available in the lower left frame diminish 
			or increase as appropriate by an amount equal to the price of the item multiplied by the <strong>Buy/Sell Rate</strong></p>
		
		<p>You can modify this total by entering a value in the <strong>Add or Subtract Funds</strong> field.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Allow Debt</strong> option enables PCGen to allow negative gold amounts to represent what the Character owes.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Ignore Cost</strong> option allows items to be added or removed without effecting the gold value.</p>
		
		<h3>Creating Masterwork/Magical/Sizing Items</h3>
		
		<p>To make an item Masterwork, Magical or change its properties (like take a regular set of plate mail and make it small-sized 
			for a small sized PC), right click on it and choose <strong>Create custom item</strong>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> The item needs to be &quot;Masterwork&quot; if a magical item is to be created.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_00_customizer.png" alt="Item Customizer" /></p>
		
		<p>To add new properties to the item, select them from the left hand pane and
		either double click or click the <strong>Add</strong> button. If the Property
		prerequisites are not met, it is shown in the default error color and it cannot
		be added. </p>
		
		<p>Other than properties, the following can be modified:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name</strong> - The name that will be displayed in the item list</li>
				<li><strong>Sprop</strong> - Any special properties that the item has</li>
				<li><strong>Cost</strong> - The purchase cost of the item</li>
				<li><strong>Weight</strong> - The weight of the item</li>
				<li><strong>Damage</strong> - The damage that the weapon does</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>Once all properties have been selected, you can click <strong>OK</strong> to add it to the item list, <strong>Buy</strong> 
			to add it to the item list and add it to the characters possessions, or <strong>Cancel</strong> to close the customizer 
			window without adding the customized item to either the list or to the character.</p>
		
<hr>

		<h2><a name="equipment">Equipment Sub-Tab</a></h2>
		
		<p>This sub-tab allows the Gear that was purchased to be equipped to the character.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipment.png" alt="Equipping Gear" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Equipment</strong> sub-tab helps you organize the gear your character owns as well as determining which 
			weapons and armor are used and in what hands. This sub-tab allows the gear that was purchased to be equipped to the 
			character. The pane on the upper-left contains the items that your character has purchased and the right pane shows 
			the equipment that has been &quot;equipped&quot; and where it has been equipped.</p>

		<p>You equip gear by selecting an item from the left pane and clicking on the <strong>Equip Selected &gt;</strong> button 
			at the bottom right of the pane.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipselection.png" alt="Equip Selection" /></p>

		<p>Weapons can be equipped as Single Handed, Two Handed and Both Hands. The equipped style determines what bonuses/penalties 
		apply. Weapons that are carried will appear on the character sheet in the weapons section.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_container.png" alt="Equipping to a Container" /></p>
		
		<p>Some items are containers and can hold other items. This can be done by &quot;equipping&quot; the items to the containers 
			directly.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipsets.png" alt="Equipment Sets" /></p>
		
		<p>It also allows the creation of multiple equipment sets so you can print output sheets based on different weapon, 
			armor and item combinations for your character.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipedpane.png" alt="Equiped Pane" /></p>

		<p>Select locations for the items your character owns on the upper right frame. Some items are automatically &quot;Equipped&quot; 
			to the appropriate locations, e.g. Armor, Shields, and magical items, if the locations are not already filled. Equipping all 
			items to the appropriate location ensures that PCGen will give the appropriate benefit for using the items. Additionally, 
			every item your character is carrying should be marked as &quot;Carried&quot; so your character's encumbrance will be 
			figured correctly.</p>
		
		<p>Every item your character is carrying should be marked &quot;Carried&quot; so your encumbrance will be figured correctly. 
			You can add additional equipment sets by typing in the name of an equipment set and clicking on the Add button (in the Upper right hand frame).</p>
