		<h1>Description Tab</h1>

		<p>The <strong>Description</strong> tab allows the customization of the PC's features.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_00_details.png" alt="Description Tab" /></p>

		<p>The left pane of this tab lists a number of notes where additional information on the current character can be 
			stored. There are a umber of standard notes provided by PCGen.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Detail</strong> note is where the height, weight, age, etc. are detailed. Each piece of detail has a 
			checkbox next to it. You can export this information to the Character sheet by clicking on the adjacent checkbox. 
			Clicking the <strong>All</strong> button at the top of the <strong>Detail</strong> note will export all detail 
			included on the page to the character sheet. Clicking the <strong>None</strong> button will prohibit all of the 
			date from being exported.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_01_portrait.png" alt="Character Portrait" /></p>

    	<p>The <strong>Portrait</strong> note provides the capability to include a character portrait on the character sheet. 
    		To add a portrait to your character simply click on the <strong>Load Portrait</strong> button beneath the &quot;Large 
    		Portrait</strong> field and navigate to the desired jpg file. PCGen will display the selected file on the page and will 
    		automatically generate a thumbnail image.You can remove the portrait from the page by clicking the <strong>Clear 
    		Portrait</strong> button.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_02_history.png" alt="Campaign History" /></p>

		<p>The <strong>Campaign History</strong> notes provides the user with a place to take notes on the characters adventures. 
			To add a campaign note simply click the <strong>Add Next Chronicle</strong> button. To delete a chronicle you will 
			click on the &quot;X&quot; button to the left of the chronicle to be deleted.</p>

		<p>As with the <strong>Detail</strong> notes, checking the checkbox on thecampaign history page will include the history 
			on the character sheet.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/descriptiontab/tab_description_03_other.png" alt="Other Notes" /></p>

		<p>PCgen's other standard notes are very similar in form and function. These include the following:
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>Bio</strong></li>
				<li>The <strong>Descriptions</strong></li>
				<li>The <strong>Companions</strong></li>
				<li>The <strong>Other Assets</strong></li>
				<li>The <strong>Magic Items</strong></li>
				<li>The <strong>GM Notes</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	    <p>The <strong>GM Notes</strong> is special as notes put in here will not be printed out on character sheets, keeping those particular 
	    	notes safe from prying eyes!</p>

		<p>You can add your en note pages to the <strong>Description</strong> tab by clicking on the <strong>Add Note</strong> 
			button. The new note will appear with a name of &quot;New Note&quot; in the right hand window and the top of the 
			new note. To rename the note you will need to edit the name in the name field above the new note. </p>

		<p>To delete a note, click on the note and select the <strong>Delete Note</strong> button. This will remove the note.</p>

		<p class="sidebar0"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The standard note pages cannot be renamed or removed.</p>
