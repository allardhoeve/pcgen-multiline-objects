		<h1>Summary Tab</h1>
		
		<p>The <strong>Summary</strong> tab is the starting point through which the user will build the PC. The tab is 
			designed to speed up character creation by having the most commonly used aspects available for quick access.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_00.png" alt="Summary Tab" /></p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_01_things.png" alt="Things to be Done" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Things to be Done</strong> pane provides a list of ot-links that, well, list things to be done. 
			Clicking on the link will take you to the Tab where the task can be completed. As you complete each item it 
			will be removed from the list.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Character Name</strong> field is for the name of the actual character for in play use/reference.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_02_name.png" alt="Naming the Character" /></p>
		
		<p>If creating names from scratch is not your forte, you can use the <strong>Random</strong></a> button found to 
			the left of the <strong>Character Name</strong> field. This button will pop up a window giving you options 
			to create a new name for your PC.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Tab Label</strong> text field is allows you to add to your character's name as well as to change how your 
			character's name appears on the tab labels within PCGen. So if your Character name was &quot;Bob the Headsman&quot;, 
			and you added &quot;The Squimish&quot; to the <strong>Tab Label</strong> field, the character output and tab labels 
			within PCGen would display &quot;The Squimish&quot;.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Player Name</strong> text field is for your name, so that when the GM has a stack of 50 characters, and he doesn't 
		remember who's character is whose by the character name, it makes their life easier.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Alignment</strong> drop down menu is to select your characters alignment.</p>
		
		<p class="center">
			<img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_03_race.png" alt="Character Race" align="middle" /> &nbsp; 
			<img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_03_raceselect.png" alt="Selecting a Character Race" align="middle" />
		</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Race</strong> drop down menu  is used for quick access to the races available from the source materials you have loaded.</p>
		
		<p class="center">
			<img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_06_class.png" alt="Character Class" align="middle" /> &nbsp; 
			<img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_06_classselect.png" alt="Selecting a Character Class" align="middle" />
		</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Class</strong> drop down menu is used for quick access to the classes available from the source materials you have 
			loaded. Classes that appear in red contain prerequisites that the character does not meet. As an example, Druids require that 
			the character have an &quot;Alignment&quot; of some flavor of &quot;Neutral&quot;.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Add Levels</strong> and <strong>Remove Levels</strong> section contains 3 elements:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>A text field where you can manually enter the level you want to add/remove. The field is automatically loaded with a 
				value of &quot;1&quot;.</li>
			<li>The <strong>+</strong> button will add the levels indicated in the text field above.</li>
			<li>The <strong>-</strong> button will remove the levels indicated in the text field above.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_09_monster.png" alt="Creating a Default Monster" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Create Monster</strong> button opens the <a href="../menupages/edit/editaddkitoptions.html">Add Kit</a> window, 
			allowing you to apply any kits your character qualifies for, including any Default Monster Kit. As long as you have not 
			selected a Race the full list of Default Monster Kits will be available to select from. This is the fast way to create 
			monsters, create a new character and add a Default Monster Kit.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Ability Point Total</strong> reports how many total character stat points you have used (Starting at zero).</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Total Mods</strong> reports your total stat modifiers from your characters stats.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_06_hp.png" alt="Modifying Hit Points" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>HP</strong></a> button will bring up the hit points window to edit the character's hit points.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_08_statistics.png" alt="Character Statistics At-a-Glance" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Statistics</strong> window, will give you a short overview of what your characters abilities are based upon the 
		race and class(es) you have selected.</p>
