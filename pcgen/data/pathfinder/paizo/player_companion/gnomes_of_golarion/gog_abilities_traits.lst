Excitable
	KEY:Excitable ~ Trait
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.CombatTrait
	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Excitable ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CombatTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:You demand that everything must happen right now, no matter what, and are too impatient to wait for everyone else to catch up. You finish people's sentences, blurt out the punch lines to slowly-told jokes, rarely make plans, and leap headlong into anything that looks like it might get interesting. While this has sometimes gotten you in trouble, it's also trained you to start moving a split second before everyone else, and that's saved your hide a few times as well.

Somehow, despite all the mischievous behavior in your life, you've never been caught-you always manage to stay one step ahead of your pursuers.		SOURCEPAGE:pg.19

	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Sprint ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CombatTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:You were taught from a young age that the world is full of big, fast, dangerous foes, and that sometimes the best course of action is to put your head down and run. Your parents taught you how to make the most of a solid mid-length sprint and how to squeeze just a little extra speed out of yourself.

Charlatan
	KEY:Charlatan ~ Trait

	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.MagicTrait
	PREALIGN:NG,TN,NE,CG,CN,CE
	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Charlatan ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.MagicTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:Your talent for illusion goes beyond a mere knack for figments and phantasms. You can actually channel spell energy into simple illusions that augment your attempts at deception. As a swift action, you may expend one prepared spell or spell slot to gain a bonus on the next Bluff check you make, provided the check takes place before the beginning of your next turn. The bonus on this check is equal to the level of the spell consumed. You may use this ability 3 times per day.

Naturally Gifted
	KEY:Naturally Gifted ~ Trait
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.MagicTrait
	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Narurally Gifted ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.MagicTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:For unknown reasons, you have deeper reserves of magical energy than those around you. Perhaps you are descended from a family of powerful arcane casters, or maybe you believe this trait marks you as destined for magical greatness. Wherever the truth lies, you gain an additional use of one of your gnome magic spell-like abilities each day. This does not always have to be the same spell-like ability-one day you might use dancing lights twice, only to use the additional casting for speak with animals the next day.
	SOURCEPAGE:pg.20

Trickster
	KEY:Trickster ~ Trait
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.MagicTrait
	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trickster ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.MagicTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:You are particularly adept with your racial spell-like abilities, and as child you quickly learned how dancing lights and ghost sound could be used to amuse your friends and fool your elders. This natural talent for illusion continued as you grew older, and before long you were being offered training in more advanced figments and glamers. You gain a +1 trait bonus to your caster level when determining the duration, range, and area of all spells from the illusion school.

	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,First Memories ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:For your whole life, you've felt there was a world just beyond the fabric of the material objects around you, and sometimes you can hear the north wind calling you or smell the dread taint of polluted water before you taste it. You do not gain the normal list of spell-like abilities for the gnome magic racial trait presented in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Instead, if you have a Wisdom of 11 of higher, you gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—detect poison, know direction, stabilize, and speak with animals. The caster level for these effects is equal to your character level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + your Wisdom modifier.

	TYPE:Trait.BasicTrait.FaithTrait
	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Zealot ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FaithTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	PRETEXT:You must match the alignment of your chosen deity exactly.
	DESC:You aren't just faithful to the worship of your patron deity-you are obsessively loyal to all of the faith's tenets and guidelines. Your devotion is an anchor that keeps you from drifting away into the throes of the Bleaching, and you cling to it like the life raft it is. As long as you remain completely faithful to the tenets of your faith (as determined by the GM), you never suffer from the Bleaching.

	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Collector ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SocialTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:You have a small, bizarre collection of apparently worthless items, such as rusty nails, animal droppings, clockwork cogs, or bent spoons. You find this strange menagerie useful in ways no non-gnome could understand. Seeking new items to add to this collection is endlessly fascinating to you, and while no one else may understand why a Chelish horsenail is worthy to add to your collection when a dwarven wheelbarrow nail is not, it all makes sense to you. Whenever you have your collection within 5 feet of you, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all %1 checks.|%LIST

	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Explorer ~ Trait],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SocialTrait]
	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:Though many gnomes settle down in communities large enough and interesting enough to provide them with all the stimulation they need to ward off the Bleaching, you’re never going to be one of them. You are always looking around the next bend in the road or over the next hill, past the borders of where you are to where you want to be. At the beginning of each character level, select one desired terrain type from the following list: cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountains (including hills), plains, planes (other than the Material Plane), swamp, underground (including caves and dungeons), urban, or water. You gain a +2 bonus on all Survival checks made in your desired terrain type. At the beginning of each level, you must select a new desired terrain type to replace the old one (you cannot take the same desired terrain type two levels in a row).

	PRERACE:1,Gnome
	DESC:When you, like all other young gnomes, were taught the hodgepodge Gnome language, you became curious about the original meaning of each word and what language it was derived from. Anytime you come across a new language, you are immediately absorbed by both how it works and what words you can co-opt from it for the Gnome language. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Linguistics checks, know one additional bonus language, and treat Linguistics as a class skill.
