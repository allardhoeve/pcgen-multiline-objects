	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality
	DESC:At 1st and 3rd level, a female drow paragon gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in cleric. A male drow paragon instead gains new spells per day as if he had gained a level of wizard. The paragon does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic feats, and so on). This essentially means that the character adds the level of drow paragon to her level in cleric or wizard, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the drow paragon is female and has no levels in cleric, or is male and has no levels in wizard, this class feature has no effect.

This bonus stacks with the extra spellcasting levels gained from the gnome paragon's spells per day entry (see above). For example, a 2nd-level wizard/3rd-level gnome paragon's caster level is 2nd for most wizard spells but 5th for wizard spells of the illusion school (and 4th for his innate spell-like abilities dancing lights, ghost sound, and prestidigitation). A 3rd-level bard/2nd-level gnome paragon's caster level is 5th for most bard spells but 7th for bard spells of the illusion school. This increased caster level affects only spells that the character can cast; it does not give him access to higher-level spells or more spells per day.
