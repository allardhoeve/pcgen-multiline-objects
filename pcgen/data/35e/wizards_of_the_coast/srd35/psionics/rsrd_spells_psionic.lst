###Block: Full Description
# Spell Name			Description
Brain Spider.MOD
	DESC:This spell allows you to eavesdrop as a standard action on the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once, hearing as desired:  Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire.  Information from all minds about one particular topic, thing, or being, one nugget of information per caster level.  A study of the thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail. Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature's mind, you can attempt (as a standard action) to implant a suggestion in the mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make another Will saving throw to resist the suggestion, using the save DC of the brain spider spell. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by the suggestion.) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the brain spider spell for that creature. You can affect all intelligent beings of your choice within range (up to the limit of eight), beginning with known or named beings. Language is not a barrier, and you need not personally know the beings The spell cannot reach those who make a successful Will save. Material Component: A spider of any size or kind. It can be dead, but must still have all eight legs.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Dweomer of Transference.MOD
	DESC:With this spell, you form a radiating corona around the head of a psionic ally, then convert some of your spells into psionic power points. When you finish casting dweomer of transference, a red-orange glow surrounds the psionic creature's head. For the duration of the spell, any spells cast at the subject don't have their usual effect, instead converting themselves harmlessly into psionic energy that the subject can use as energy for psionic powers. You can cast any spell you like at the subject, even area spells, effect spells, and spells for whom the subject would ordinarily not be a legitimate target. The spells don't do anything other than provide the subject with power points, but you must still cast them normally, obeying the component and range requirements listed in the description of each spell. For each spell you cast into the dweomer of transference, the psionic creature gets temporary power points, according to the following table. The transference isn't perfectly efficient. The temporary power points acquired through a dweomer of transference dissipate after 1 hour if they haven't already been spent.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Glossolalia.MOD
	DESC:You utter shrieks of nonsense and gibberish that thinking creatures find distracting and confusing. The spell affects only creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher. Any such creatures within the spell's area must succeed on Fortitude saves or be stunned for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores of 20 or higher), dazed for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores between 10 and 19), or shaken for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores between 3 and 9). In addition, a creature within the spell's area loses any psionic focus it might have had and takes a -4 penalty on Concentration checks for 1 round. These effects happen whether or not the creature succeeded on its save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Mental Pinnacle.MOD
	DESC:For a brief time, you achieve the mental dominance of a powerful psion, able to lash out at enemies using only the power of your mind. Your revel in your new mental powers to the point that you disdain using spells, even in the form of effects from magic items. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and Wisdom, 3 power points per caster level, and access to the following powers.  Mind ThrustA: Deal 1d10 damage.  Ego WhipA: Deal 1d4 Cha damage and daze for 1 round.  Psionic BlastA: Stun creatures in 30-ft. cone for 1 round.  Id Insinuation: Swift tendrils of thought disrupt and confuse your target.  Psychic CrushA: Brutally crush subject's mental essence, reducing subject to -1 hit points. You manifest the powers as a psion of your caster level does, creating displays as described in each power's description. You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if those spells were no longer on your class list. For the duration of this spell, you use magic items and psionic items as if you were a psion with only the five powers given above on your class list. Any unspent power points dissipate when the spell ends. Material Component: A potion of fox's cunning, which you drink (its effect is overridden by the effect of this spell).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Psychic Turmoil.MOD
	DESC:With this spell, you create an invisible field that leeches away the power points of psionic characters standing within the emanation. Nonpsionic characters are unaffected. When the spell is cast and at the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, psionic creatures within the area of the psychic turmoil lose 1 power point per manifester level they have. Characters who succeed on a Will save when they first come into contact with the emanation lose only half as many power points (round down) each round. Characters get only one save attempt against any particular psychic turmoil effect, even if they leave the spell's area and later return. Material Component: Five playing cards, which are torn in half when the spell is cast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
