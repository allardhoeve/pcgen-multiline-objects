	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary
	VISIBLE:YES
	BENEFIT:If the blackguard's character level is 16th or higher, the servant gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls, checks, and saves if it witnesses the blackguard being threatened or harmed. This bonus lasts as long as the threat is immediate and apparent.

	OUTPUTNAME:Cannot be Turned or Rebuked
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality

Command Own Kind
	OUTPUTNAME:Command creatures of its kind
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality
	VISIBLE:YES
	BENEFIT:Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if it's being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect.

	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality

Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his companion does.

The owner cannot see through the psicrystal's senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically as if the psicrystal were the target of a mindlink power manifested by the owner. For instance, a psicrystal placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room. Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that room as if he has seen it too.
