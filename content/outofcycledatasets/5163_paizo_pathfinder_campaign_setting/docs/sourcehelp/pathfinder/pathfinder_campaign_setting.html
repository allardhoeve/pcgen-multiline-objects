	<p class="indent1">PAIZO PUBLISHING &gt; PATHFINDER CORNICLES</p>
	<p class="indent2"><strong>Paizo - Pathfinder Chronicles: Campaign Setting</strong></p>
			
	<p class="indent1">This dataset has been coded for use in the 35e gameMode for which it was originaly written as well as a conversion set for use in the Pathfinder Role Playing Game gameMode. Because of the differences in rules there are some necessary changes made to the pathfinder conversion set, the most noticable change is with skill prerequisites. Most skill prerequisites will be 3 ranks less in Pathfinder because of the changes to the skill systems, there are also a number of changes to the skills themselves which have to be accounted for, certain skills were consolodated into one skill and some skills disabpered altogether. Where possible we used information in the <a href="http://paizo.com/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy89m6&source=search">Conversion Guide</a> to dictate how to convert the data but there was not always a clear conversion path. In those cases we did our best to stay true to the spirit of the game, we hope you find our decisions satisfying.</p>
	
    <h3>Races</h3>
    
    <p class="indent1">This setting presents a number of Human ethnicities, these are represented by templates which will cause the ethnicity to appear in parentheses next to &quot;Human&quot; in the race block of the output sheet. When choosing the Human race a pop up window will appear to allow the selection of an ethniciy, these templates are all visible so you can remove and add them as needed in the Template tab.</p>
    
    <h3>Classes</h3>
    
    <p class="indent1">This setting presents a number of optional features for the base classes which can be taken in exchange for a standard class feature. In most cases these have been coded as substitution levels, when the class is added a pop up window will apear at 1st or 3rd level (depending on when the optional feature first manifests) asking you to choose between the standard class and the Pathfinder varient. In a few cases substitution class levels were not needed as the new feature is just an additional choice taken where the standard class is already granted a choice.</p>
    <p class="indent1">For the conversion set most of these optional features were easy to convert, some did not even require different code. The most radical departure was the Sorcerer, the class feature given up for the new option is the Familiar. The Pathfinder Sorcerer does not have a Familiar and so the bonus feat Eschew Materials is given up in it's place.</p>
	
	
    <h3>Feats</h3>
    
    <p class="indent1">Vermin Companion. The animal companion feature has been altered quite extensively in the Pathfinder Role Playing Game, Companion versions of animals have different stats than those of the animal they are based on. In order to implement this for Pathfinder we have had to create the Vermiin Companions stats ourselves, we hope you find them useful.</p>
