DESC:Welcome to the first part of the playtest of Ultimate Magic, an April 2011 sourcebook for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. In the past, we have playtested a host of class features and options before releasing the final versions, and the playtest for this book will be no different. To get things started, we are going to be looking at the new base class set to appear in Ultimate Magic, the magus. This class is a blend of weapon specialist and arcane spellcaster. While not truly a master of either, the class blends the two arts in new and interesting ways. Take this class and use it in your game, as a PC, an NPC, or perhaps even a villain. Once you've had a chance to see it in action, head over the messageboards at paizo.com and look for the Ultimate Magic playtest forum. Inside you will find a folder for announcements and general discussion as well as a folder for the magus playtest. We are looking for feedback from your play experience with this class. While general observation is useful, actual play experience is far more valuable to our development process. In other words, get out there and play! The playtest has been an extremely useful tool for us in the past, and I expect this round to be no different.
