Spell Combat
	KEY:Spell Combat Output
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can cast spells and wield your weapons effectively at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a -4 penalty. You can also cast any spell with a casting time of 1 standard action from the magus spell list. You must cast this spell defensively, and you take a -2 penalty on the concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still suffer the -4 penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks if you have more than one attack. Casting a spell in this manner does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must have one hand free to use this ability, even if the spell being cast does not contain somatic components.

True Magus
	KEY:True Magus ~ Magus
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:You are a master of spells and combat. You can cast spells and wield your weapons effectively at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand.

Alternatively, you can make a free touch attack with your free hand instead of delivering the spell through your weapon, as normal.

	DESC:You can cast magus spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.

Arcane Weapon
	KEY:Arcane Weapon ~ Magus
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural
	DEFINE:MagusArcaneWeaponLVL|0
	DEFINE:MagusArcaneWeaponBonus|0
	DESC:You can imbue a melee weapon with powerful abilities. When you prepare your spells, you can also spend a portion of this time bonding with a single melee weapon. This grants the weapon a +%1 enhancement bonus. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5, or they can be used be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the weapon is bonded and cannot be changed until the next time the magus prepares spells. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus. Bonding with a weapon in this way is not without danger. A magus that is bonded to a weapon must have the weapon in hand to cast spells from the magus spell list; otherwise he must make a concentration check to cast such spells. The DC of this check is equal to 20 + the spell's level.|MagusArcaneWeaponBonus

Weapon Bond
	KEY:Weapon Bond ~ Magus
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural
	DESC:If you are bonded to a weapon through the arcane weapon class feature, you can call that weapon to your hand as a free action once per round. The weapon appears in your hand instantly, even if it is in the possession of another creature or on another plane of existence. This ability does not function in areas that prevent or block teleportation magic or planar travel. Alternatively, you can teleport to the nearest open square to your bonded weapon, as if using Greater Teleport, except that you cannot bring any other creatures with you. In addition, if the weapon is not in your possession, you can scry on it at will and any creature in possession of the item takes a -8 penalty on its saving throw to resist this scrying.
