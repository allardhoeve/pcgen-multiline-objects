		<h1>PCGen 4E Data Set Creation: Ability Categories and Abilities</h1>
	
		<p class="indent0">In this lesson we will learn how abilitycategories and abilities interact, as 
			well as how to create abilities using abilitycategories.</p>
			
		<h2>Understanding Ability Categories</h2>
		<p class="indent0">The Basis for grouping abilities are the <code>ABILITYCATEGORY</code> tag, which is 
			the foundation upon which the abilities are used. There are two types of ability category; the Superset, 
			or Parent, and the Subset, or Child. The following tags are used to build an ability category of 
			either type.</p>
		<dl class="indent1">
			<dt><strong>ABILITYCATEGORY</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is the name of the ability category, which can be either a 'parent' or 'child'. This is 
				the first tag on every line in the abilitycategory file.</dd>
			<dt><strong>CATEGORY</strong></dt>
			<dd>This will determine whether this Abilitycategory is a parent or child. If the ability category 
				and category names match, then it's a parent, anything else will result in a child category.</dd>
			<dt><strong>TYPE</strong></dt>
			<dd>This is a required tag for a child. It determines which abilities will be listed under the parent 
				category. The Type can have multiple values identified in one tag by using a period-delimited list of 
				types. In PCGen, we use the period (.) to denote the logical AND function. Therefore, 
				<code>TYPE:Monkey.General</code> is the equivalent of &quot;This object is both type Monkey and 
				General&quot;.</dd>
			<dt><strong>VISIBLE</strong></dt>
			<dd>Determines whether or not it abilities of this category are visible in the GUI. Valid values are 
				'YES' (default), 'NO' and 'QUALIFY'. Setting <code>QUALIFY</code> will mean it will only display 
				if the point pool has one or greater points available, or you have abilities of that category already 
				selected.</dd>
			<dt><strong>EDITABLE</strong></dt>
			<dd>Determines whether you can add entries. In the GUI you will still see the right hand pane, 
				but the left pane disappears. (For some reason even if set to NO, you can still remove 
				abilities, but will not be able to add anything)</dd>
			<dt><strong>EDITPOOL</strong></dt>
			<dd>Determines whether you can alter the points in the ability pool for this category. Valid values for 
				this tag are 'YES' and 'NO'.</dd> 
			<dt><strong>FRACTIONALPOOL</strong></dt>
			<dd>Determines whether a pool can have fractions. Valid values for this tag are 'YES' and 'NO'. If the 
				tag is set to <code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code>, the pool can contain whole numbers only. If you set 
				your abilities to have a fractional cost, you will need to set the value as <code>FRACTIONALPOOL:YES</code>.
				NOTE: The Ability must contain a <code>COST</code> tag with a fraction number for this to work correctly. e.g. <code>COST:.5</code></dd>
			<dt><strong>DISPLAYLOCATION</strong></dt>
			<dd>Sets the parent or child to appear in a certain group. e.g. 'Feats' would make it display under the 
				'Feats Tab' while 'Class Abilities' would show it under 'Class Abilities'. Even a <code>VISIBLE:NO</code> 
				ability category will show up as a tab if the <code>DISPLAYLOCATION</code> is either one that does 
				not currently exist or you don't have one set up. In the absence of this tag it defaults to the 
				name of ability category.</dd>
			<dt><strong>PLURAL</strong></dt>
			<dd>Determines how the name appears in the drop down list. Normally you add an &quot;s&quot; at the end to 
				indicate multiples, or "plural", e.g. <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:Monkey Fu Choice &lt;tab&gt; PLURAL:Monkey Fu 
				Choices</code>.</dd>
		</dl>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Example Parent Ability Category</strong></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:Skill Training</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITABLE:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITPOOL:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:Skill Training</code></p>
		<p class="indent3">The <code>ABILITYCATEGORY</code> and <code>CATEGORY</code> match, making &quot;Skill 
			Training&quot; a parent category. Note that you do not need the <code>TYPE</code>, <code>DISPLAYLOCATION</code> 
			or <code>PLURAL</code> tags for a parent.</p>

		<p class="sidebar1"><strong>Note:</strong> At this time it is unknown how few tags are required for a parent.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Example child Ability Category</strong></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:Cleric Class Skills</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:QUALIFY</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITABLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:Skill Training</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:Cleric</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>DISPLAYLOCATION:1st Level Skill Training</code></p>
		<p class="indent3">The ability category name is different from the category making &quot;Cleric Class Skills&quot; 
			a child category.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Now that we understand how to set up a basic parent and child ability category, we need to 
			populate the categories with abilities from which selections can be made.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h2>Bringing the Ability Category and the Abilities Together</h2>

		<p class="indent0">Using our existing child ability category &quot;Cleric Class Skills&quot;, I want my Cleric 
			to have one choice, so I'll use the following tag:</p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Cleric Class Skills|1</code></p>
		<p class="indent0">This will grant one choice from the &quot;Cleric Class Skills&quot; pool. However, the list 
			is, at this time, empty. In order to populate the list we need abilities of the correct category as well 
			as type. Our ability, using the &quot;Cleric Class Skills&quot; child category, is part of the &quot;Skill 
			Training&quot; parent category, but having an ability with the category of &quot;Skill Training&quot; will 
			accomplish nothing by itself. We need to tell it what abilities go in the &quot;Cleric Class Skills&quot; 
			pool. To do this, we use the <code>TYPE</code> tag.</p>
		<p class="indent0">By adding the <code>TYPE:Cleric</code> tag to the ability, we are telling PCGen to include 
			this ability in the list of abilities available through this pool.</p>
		<p class="sidebar1">This is opposite from how feats work in that without a type a feat will automatically be 
			displayed.</p>

		<p class="indent0">In an Ability, like in most other PCGen objects, Type is simply a characteristic of the 
			object and these objects can have more than one type. Generally <code>TYPE</code> can be used to organize 
			objects into groups. However, in Abilities, <type>TYPE</code> is used to create the sets of objects that 
			appear in an ability category or in a child ability category.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>Dummy Object</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:Cleric</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:Skill Training</code></p>

		<p class="indent0"><span class="lstobj">Dummy Object</span> is part of the &quot;Skill Training&quot; ability 
			category and could be purchased with a point from that pool. We just repeat this until all the abilities 
			we want are part of the ability category. Also, you may have more than one &quot;type&quot; in an ability. 
			To give an ability more than one type, you simply list them in a period-delimited list with the 
			<code>TYPE</code> tag, thus, if we replace <code>TYPE:Cleric</code> in the example above with  
			<code>TYPE:Cleric.Monkey Fu</code>, the ability <span class="lstobj">Dummy Object</span> is of both the 
			&quot;Cleric&quot; and &quot;Monkey Fu&quot; types and can be pulled into any ability pool using either 
			type.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Note that the category, with the ability name, make the unique key for the ability, so an 
			ability can have more than one type, but it is only allowed one category. You may even have abilities with 
			the same name, but they must be of different categories.</p>
		<p class="indent0">Let's say we have three abilities named <span class="lstobj">Monkey Bar</span>, each with a 
			category of &quot;Special Ability&quot;, &quot;Fighter&quot; and &quot;FEAT&quot; respectively. This 
			would be shown as:</p>
		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY=Special Ability|Monkey Bar</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY=Fighter|Monkey Bar</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY=FEAT|Monkey Bar</code></p>
		</blockquote>

		<p class="indent0">This is very useful when we want to modify an ability with the <code>.MOD</code> tag. 
			In the ability file, simply add the old ability name on a new line with the <code>.MOD</code> 
			tacked to the end of it. Then add the tags required to modify the ability to suit your needs, 
			making sure to change the category with the <code>CATEGORY</code> tag.</p>


		<p class="indent0">We have several groupings of Abilities.</p>
		<p class="indent0">Datasets from 3e typically use multiple ability categories, including:</p>
		<p class="indent1">Special Abilities - These will be where you place MOST of your abilities
		<p class="indent0">- In order to group anything, you will use the 'CATEGORY:' tag.

		<p class="indent1"><code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Denotes the ability belongs to the Special Ability category.

		<p class="indent1"><code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
		<p class="indent2">Is how a Feat would be displayed in an ABILITY file, otherwise in a basic feat file it's 
			assumed and is not required.</p>

		<p class="indent0">we tend to name these the same as what appears in the rule book for clarity
--

		<p class="indent0">I would suggest the following ABILITYCATEGORIES:</p>
		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2">Special Ability (This will be in the Gamemode)
			<p class="indent2">First Level (This is optional)
			<p class="indent2">Skill Training (A suggested spot for your class skills)
			<p class="indent2">Class Skills (One for each Class)
			<p class="indent2">Class Choices (One for each class that has a choice inside their begining abilities)
			<p class="indent2">Powers (I would break those up into How often they can be used and the different Tiers)
			<p class="indent2">### Class Feat - Uncertain at this time
		</blockquote>

		<p class="indent0">AS you progress you may find you need more. But this should get your mind in 
			the right spot.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h2>Abilities</h2>

		<p class="indent0">Now Onto Ability examples.</p>

		<p class="indent0">One of the more complex things to code for beginners would be Skill Training so we 
			will use the example built in the class instruction for 4e.</p>

		<p class="indent0">How do I indicate I am trained in certain skills?</p>

		<p class="indent0">I'll use an Ability file. I can also use a Feat file, but they are essentially the 
			same thing, and you'll see this makes more sense as we progress. Normally we place FEATS in a Feat 
			file so you can use PREFEAT, but these next couple of feats are special cases.</p>

		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>Skill Training</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:General.HeroicMonkey</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>MULT:YES</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CHOOSE:SKILLSNAMED|ALL</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>BONUS:SKILL|LIST|1</code></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="indent0">NOTE: CATEGORY is only required if you place this in an ability file. FEAT is an 
			automatic given in a Feat File.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Wow, that is simple yes? So whenever I need my Monkey Warrior to become trained 
			in a skill he takes this feat.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Well, lets add upon this... Monkey Warrior has a base set of skills he learns, 
			so... Let's say he has a Skill he can take called Monkey Vine Swinging. (Hey Chimps love to swing!)</p>

		<p class="indent0">So in an ability file we would create this: (This next one must be an ability file to 
			work correctly!)</p>

		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>Trained Class Skill (Monkey Vine Swinging)</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:Skill Training</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:MonkeyWarrior</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Skill Training(Monkey Vine Swinging)</code></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="indent0">This last part is key... It tells PCGen that we've taken the Skill Training and 
			assigned Monkey Vine Swinging. So if you take Skill Training again, Monkey Vine Swinging will 
			not be a choice/</p>

		<p class="indent0">You must do this for each skill you have in your skill list. Also, TYPE is a very 
			KEY factor here. It's important because TYPE is used to place thigns into ability categories. 
			You want your TYPE to have the Class that gets this particular class skill. If Healing Monkey 
			and Warrior Monkey get the same skill then use the period to put both in the TYPE. Like so:</p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>TYPE:Monkey Warrior.Healing Monkey</code></p>
		<p class="indent0">Remember the earlier lesson how a TYPE assigns it to a pool? Well, if you set 
			up your abilitycategories correctly and have Healing Monkey Skills using TYPE:Healing Monkey 
			and also a Warrior Monkey with TYPE:Warrior Monkey. Then this one skill will show up in both 
			pools or lists.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<p class="indent0">Onto the next part...</p>

		<p class="indent0">OKay, My Monkey Warrior loves Vine Swinging so much he wants to focus more feats 
			to become better (Cause really, want monkey doesn't focus on simple pleasures?)</p>

		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>Skill Focus</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:General.HeroicMonkey</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Skill Training</code></p>
			<p class="indent3">(If doing all in a feat file then this becomes 'PREFEAT:1,Skill Training')</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>MULT:YES</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CHOOSE:FEAT=Skill Training</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>BONUS:SKILL|LIST|1</code></p>
		</blockquote>

		<p class="indent0">Depending on the type of file you use will factor into how you use the 
			PRExxx tags. A Feat File works with PREFEAT, where a ABILITY File works with PREABILITY. 
			Though they should be interchangeable you should be aware of the subtle differences. Also, 
			any ABILITY with a category other than FEAT will NOT take PREFEAT. So, PREFEAT:1,Dodge and 
			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge should work just fine... But try to keep this in mind. If 
			all your feats are created in an ABILITY file, then restrict yourself to using 
			PREABILITY:x,CATEGORY=y,z format. (See Tag Index Docs for specific tag usage).</p>
		<p class="indent0">Okay, that covers the more difficult aspects of Monkey Skills.
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h3>Class Abilities</h3>
		<p class="indent0">Now, Class Abilities...</p>

		<p class="indent0">Monkey Warrior has a Special Class Feature which Allows him to use  
			'Monkey Warrior Fu'  and 'Monkey Warrior Banana Fling'</p>

		<p class="indent0">In order for that to work we need to create those abilities here. 
			Recap of how the class is calling them:</p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Monkey Warrior Fu|Monkey Warrior 
			Banana Fling</code></p>

		<p class="indent0">So, to break that tag into basic pieces, first it tells pcgen this is 
			an ability located in an ability file, next it tells pcgen the abilitycategory of the 
			ability. That is KEY to understanding where the program looks for the ability, finally 
			we tell pcgen how this ability will appear on the character. The Nature is very important.</p>
		<p class="indent0">We have three Natures:</p>
		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>NORMAL</code> charges a pool point and also will NOT add the ability if 
				you do not meet the Prereqs.</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>AUTOMATIC</code> does not charge to the pool, this will automatically appear on 
				the character (Yellow unless you changed your preferences)</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>VIRTUAL</code> bypasses any requirements and will not charge the pool. 
				(Appears purple by default)</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p class="indent0">Finally we tell PCGen what the Ability Name is. In this case 
			Monkey Warrior Fu and Monkey Warrior Banana Fling.</p>

		<p class="sidebar1">NOTE: That each ability is separated by a pipe (|). Do not use 
			periods (.) or commas (,) or you will have issues.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Okay, so now we know how the ability is called, now we must make the ability.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Making an ability is not hard, inside the ability we can use any global tag. 
			(See docs for global tags). So what we need to know is what the ability should do.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Monkey Warrior Fu grants our monkey warrior weapon proficiencies, armor 
			and shield proficiencies and the ability to Shout each time he gets into a fight but only once.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Each Line indented indicates a tab for ease of flow.</p>

		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>Monkey Warrior Fu</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:CLass Ability</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>AUTO:WEAPONPROF|Monkey Claws|Monkey Bite|Monkey Fists</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>AUTO:ARMORPROF|Monkey Jacket</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>AUTO:SHIELDPROF|Bananna Buckler</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>SAB:Monkey Warrior Shout ~ Once per fight you can instill the 
				fear of the monkey. At 12th level this Shout deals 1d10 bad breath damage.</code></p>
		</blockquote>

		<p class="indent0">At 1st - 10th level Monkey Warrior can fling bananas that can do an extra 
			1d10 damage (Hey, he has big bananas!). at 11th to 20th his Bananas deal 2d10 damage, and 
			finally he's mastered the Banana flinging so well that 21st to 30th level he does 4d10 
			damage. So we want to track his damage. You can either note that damage in his ability, 
			or PCGen can calculate that damage for you. We need two tags. DEFINE and BONUS:VAR. For 
			the class level line, we only need to place the BONUS:VAR, but the DEFINE tag will need 
			to be done in his ability.</p>

		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2"><code>Monkey Warrior Banana Fling</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:Class Ability.SpecialAttack</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:Special Ability</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>SAB:Monkey Fling Banana ~ fling Banana 30 ft and deals 
				%d% damage|MonkeyBananaDamage|MonkeyBananaDie</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>DEFINE:MonkeyBananaDamage|0</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>DEFINE:MonkeyBananaDie|10</code></p>
		</blockquote>

		<p class="indent0">NOTE: DESC tag should be enabled on the NEW Output Sheet and PDF. 
			In that case using special TYPES will make it appear in different places. In this 
			SpecialAttack will appear in the SPecial Attack section. However, DESC uses a 
			slightly different wildcard. Instead of just '%' for each variable in a row, it 
			uses a slightly more intelligent mechanic of '%' followed by the number that the 
			variable appears in.</p>

		<p class="indent0">e.g.
		<p class="indent1"><code>DESC: I throw %1 rocks per round  plus %2d%3+%1 damage for 
			%4 rounds|Example1|Example2|Example3|Example4</code></p>

		<p class="indent0">Now lets say:</p>
		<blockquote class="indent0">
			<p class="indent2">Example1 = 5
			<p class="indent2">Example2 = 1
			<p class="indent2">Example3 = 4
			<p class="indent2">Example4 = 8
		</blockquote>

		<p class="indent0">The <code>DESC</code> tag above would output the following line of text: 
			&quot;I throw 5 rocks per round  plus 1d4+5 for 8 rounds&quot;.</p>

		<p class="indent0">Okay, that is the basics of creating class abilities, which can also 
			be racial abilities.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<p class="indent0">We've covered the basics of creating ABILITYCATEGORY tags to create pools 
			and learned how to make the abilities so they are put in those pools.</p>

		<p class="indent0">I think this covers the basics for abilities. If we come across more 
			advanced techniques to be explained they will covered in an advanced series.
