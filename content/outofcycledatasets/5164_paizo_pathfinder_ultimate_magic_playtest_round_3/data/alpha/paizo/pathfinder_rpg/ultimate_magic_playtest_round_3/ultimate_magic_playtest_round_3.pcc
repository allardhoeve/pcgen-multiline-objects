DESC:Welcome to the third round of the Ultimate Magic playtest, with another look at the new magus base class. This is a class that many of you have already been playing with since the first playtest round a few months ago. We took a great deal of your feedback and heavily revised a number of elements of this class. While it is not yet perfect, it is a huge step in the right direction.
