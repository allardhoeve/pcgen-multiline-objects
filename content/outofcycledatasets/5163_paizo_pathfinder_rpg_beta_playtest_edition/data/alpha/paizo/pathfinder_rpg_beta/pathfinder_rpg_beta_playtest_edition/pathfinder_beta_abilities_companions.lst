	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality
	VISIBLE:YES
	DESC:%1/day a mount can use this ability to command any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself, as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Spellcraft check to succeed if the target is being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect.|SMLevel/2
