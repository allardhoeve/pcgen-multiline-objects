\par WONDROUS ITEM DESCRIPTIONS}{
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Amulet of Health}{
\par This amulet grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to Constitution of +2, +4, or +6.
\par Caster Level: 8th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, endurance; Market Price: 4, 000 gp (+2), 16,000 gp (+4), or 36,000 gp (+6); Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Amulet of Natural Armor}{
\par This toughens the wearer\rquote s body and flesh, giving him or her a natural armor bonus to AC of from +1 to +5, depending on the type of amulet.
\par Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, barkskin, creator\rquote s caster level must be at least three times the amu\-let\rquote 
s bonus; Market Price: 2,000 gp (+1), 8,000 gp (+2), 18,000 gp (+3), 32,000 gp (+4), or 50,000 gp (+5); Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Amulet of the Planes}{
\par This amulet allows its wearer to utilize plane shift. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user must make an Intelligence check (DC 15) in order to get the amulet to take him or her to the plane (and the specific location on that pl
ane) that the user wants. If the user fails, the amulet transports him or her and all those traveling with the user to a random location on that plane (a 01-60 result on d%) or to a random plane (61-100).
\par Caster Level: 15th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Market Price: 80,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location}{
\par This amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a nondetection spell does. If a divination is attempted against the wearer, the 
caster of the divination must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had cast nondetection on his or herself).
\par Caster Level: 8th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, nondetection; Market Price: 35,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par 
\par }{\cs19\i Amulet of Undead Turning}{
\par This holy item allows a cleric or paladin to turn undead as if he or she were four levels higher than his or her actual class level.
\par Caster Level: 10th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, 10th-level cleric; Market Price: 11,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Bag of Holding}{
\par The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag\rquote 
s contents, depend on the bag\rquote s type, as shown on the table below:
\par Bag\tab Bag\tab Weight\tab \tab Volume\tab Market
\par Type\tab Weight\tab Limit\tab \tab Limit\tab \tab Price
\par ----\tab ------\tab ------\tab \tab ------\tab \tab ------
\par Bag 1\tab 15 lb.\tab 250 lb.\tab \tab 30 cu. ft.\tab 2,500 gp
\par Bag 2\tab 25 lb.\tab 500 lb.\tab \tab 70 cu. ft.\tab 5,000 gp
\par Bag 3\tab 35 lb.\tab 1,000 lb.\tab 150 cu. ft.\tab 7,400 gp
\par Bag 4\tab 60 lb.\tab 1,500 lb.\tab 250 cu. ft.\tab 10,000 gp
\par If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a bag of h
olding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a s
pecific item from a bag of holding is a move \-equivalent action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.
\par If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift
 to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radiu
s are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.
\par Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Bag of Tricks}{
\par This small sack appears normal and empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a sm
all, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. There are 
three drab colors of bags, each producing a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.

\par Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to ten animals can be drawn from the bag each week.
\par Caster Level: 3rd (gray), 5th (rust), or 9th (tan); Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item; summon nature\rquote s ally II (gray), summon nature\rquote s ally III (rust), or summon nature\rquote s ally V (tan); Market Price: 900 gp (gray); 3,000
 gp (rust); 6,300 gp (tan); Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Bead of Force}{
\par Upon sharp impact this bead explodes, sending forth a burst of force that deals 5d6 points of damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. Each victim is allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 16). Those
 who fail are then encapsulated in a sphere of force with a radius of 10 feet. Those trapped inside cannot escape except by those methods that can bypass or destroy a wall of force. The sphere persists for 3d6 minutes and then disappears. The explosion co
mpletely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.
\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, wall of force; Market Price: 2,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Belt, Monk\rquote s}{
\par This simple rope belt, when wrapped around a character\rquote s waist, confers great abi
lity in unarmed combat. Any time the wearer engages in unarmed combat, the belt grants him or her the ability to use both hands as though the wearer possessed the Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting feats. The wearer may also make a stunning attack (as 
a monk) once per day. If donned by a monk, the belt grants one additional stunning attack per day and allows the monk to haste him or herself once per day for up to 10 consecutive rounds.
\par Caster Level: 12th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, haste, righteous might or transformation; Market Price: 9,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Belt of Dwarvenkind}{
\par This belt gives the wearer a +4 competence bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-keyed skill ch
ecks as they relate to dealing with dwarves, a +2 competence bonus on similar checks when dealing with gnomes and halflings, and a -2 competence penalty on similar checks when dealing with anyone else. The wearer can understand, speak, and read Dwarven. I
f the wearer is not a dwarf, he or she gains darkvision (range 60 feet), dwarven stonecunning, a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and +2 resistance bonuses against poison, spells, and spell-like effects.
\par Caster Level: 12th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, tongues, and either polymorph self or the creator must be a dwarf; Market Price: 14,900 gp; Weight: 1 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Belt of Giant Strength}{
\par This belt adds to the wearer\rquote s Strength score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +4 or +6.
\par Caster Level: 10th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, bull\rquote s strength; Market Price: 16,000 gp (+4) or 36,000 gp (+6); Weight: 1 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Boat, Folding}{
\par A folding boat looks like a small wooden box-about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It can be used to store item
s like any other box. If a command word is given, however, the box unfolds itself to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second (different) command word causes it to unfold to a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. An
y objects formerly stored in the box now rest in the bottom of the boat or ship.
\par In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a ste
ering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold three or four people comfortably, while the ship carries fifteen with ease.
\par A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again. The words of command may be inscribed visibly or invisibly on the box, or they may be written elsewhere.
\par Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, 2 ranks of Craft (shipmaking); Market Price: 10,500 gp; Weight: 4 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Blessed Book}{
\par This well-made tome is always of small size, typically no more than 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. All such books are durable, waterproof, bound with iron overlaid with silver, and locked.
\par The pages of a Blessed Book freely accept spells scribed upon them, and any such book can contain up to forty-five spells of any level.  This book is never found as randomly generated treasure with spells already inscribed in it.
\par Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, secret page; Market Price: 9,500 gp; Weight: 1 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Boots of Elvenkind}{
\par These soft boots enable the wearer to move quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a +10 circumstance bonus to Move Silently checks.
\par Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be an elf; Market Price: 2,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Boots of Levitation}{
\par These leather boots allow the wearer to levitate as if he or she had cast levitate on him or herself.
\par Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, levitate; Market Price: 7,500 gp; Weight: 1 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Boots of Speed}{

\par This large container is about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a 
Large water elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the bowl functions as the summon monster VI spell. Only one elemental can be called at a time. A new elemental requires the bowl to be filled with new water, whi

\par This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are \-
spoken, a Large fire elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the brazier functions as the summon monster VI spell. If br
imstone is added, the elemental is Huge instead of Large, and the brazier works as a summon monster VII spell. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new fire, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappear

\par A cleric whose alignment matches the candle\rquote s

of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), the candle burns for 4 hours.
\par In addition, burning the candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment
 as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out. Placing the candle in a lantern for protection doesn\rquote t interfere with its magical properties.

ip. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth a Large air elemental. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the censer functions as the summon monster VI spell. If incense of meditation is bu
r
ned within the censer, the air elemental is an elder air elemental instead (as if summon monster IX had just been cast). Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new piece of incense, which cannot be lit until after the fir

\par Chime of Opening}{
\par A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magic vib
rations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. The chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or an arcane lock cast by a wizard of les
s than 15th level.
\par The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the
 secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 50 times before it cracks and becomes useless.

\par Cube of Frost Resistance}{
\par When this cube is activated, it encloses a cube-shaped area 10 feet per side. The temperature within this area is always at least 65\'b0F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. How\-
ever, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses and cannot be renewed for 1 hour. If the field receives over 100 points of damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.

\par Cubic Gate}{
\par Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The character 
creating the item should choose the planes to which the other five sides are keyed. If such a cube is found as treasure, the DM can determine the planes accessed by the device in any manner he or she chooses.
\par If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it
 opens a gate to the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to 
open more than one gate at a time.
\par If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to the other plane, along with all creatures in a 5-foot radius. (Those others may avoid this fate by succeeding at Will saves against DC 23).

\par Geyser: 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round

\par Deck of Illusions}{
\par This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of thirty-four cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled.
 
The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes bl

\par Apparatus of the Crab}{
\par This item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate) that opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers:

\par Operating a lever is a full-round a
ction, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two Medium-size characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round (one character moves the apparatus and the other causes it to attack). The device c

\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Drums of Panic}{
\par These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1 1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs 
and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a fear spell (Will negates DC 16).
\par Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, fear; Market Price: 30,000 gp; Weight: 10 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Dust of Appearance}{
\par This fine powder appears to be a very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats surrounding objects, making them visib
le even if they are invisible-just like the glitterdust spell. (The dust of appearance, however, doesn\rquote 
t blind creatures.) The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they are. It likewise negates the effects of blur and di
splacement. (In this, it works just like the faerie fire spell). A creature coated with the dust cannot hide. The dust\rquote s effect lasts for 2d% minutes.
\par Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone blow-tubes.
\par Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, glitterdust; Market Price: 2,100 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Dust of Disappearance}{
\par A creature or object touched by this dust becomes invisible (as improved invisibility). Normal vision can\rquote 
t see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including see invisibility or invisibility purge. Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by dust of disappearance. Other factors, such as sou
nd and smell, also allow possible detection.
\par The improved invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d10 minutes (1d10+10 if sprinkled carefully upon an object).
\par Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, improved invisibility; Market Price: 3,500 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Dust of Dryness}{
\par This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, up to a cubic yard of the water is instantly transformed to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. 
If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.
\par If the dust is employed against a water creature, the creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 18) or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the water creature even if its saving throw succeeds.
\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, control water; Market Price: 850 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Dust of Illusion}{
\par This unremarkable powder resem
bles chalk dust or powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and form. Put the dust of illusion on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a change self glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning th
e illusion desired. An unwilling recipient is allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 11) to escape the effect. The glamer lasts for 1d6+6 hours.
\par Caster Level: 2nd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, change self; Market Price: 500 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Dust of Tracelessness}{
\par Tossing a pinch of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 1,000 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.
\par A pinch of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evi
dence of the passage of as many as a dozen people and horses to be obliterated for a mile back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, so no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Tracking checks across an area aff
ected by this dust are made against a DC 20 higher than normal.
\par Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, pass without trace; Market Price: 250 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Efficient Quiver}{
\par This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding abo
ut 20 arrows. Examination shows that it has three distinct portions, each with an extradimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to 60 objects of the same general size and sh
a
pe as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to 18 objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as six objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (including
 spears, staffs, etc.). Once the owner has filled it, the owner can command the quiver each round to produce any stored items he or she wishes.

\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Efreeti Bottle}{
\par This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the b
ottle instantly. There is a 10% chance (a 01-10 result on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91-100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, the efreeti after
ward disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11-90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti\rquote 
s death), doing as the character commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day\rquote s effect.
\par Caster Level: 14th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VII; Market Price: 150,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

\par Everburning Torch}{
\par This torch has a continual flame cast upon it.
\par Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisite: Continual flame (no feat needed); Market Price: 90 gp; Weight: 1 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Eversmoking Bottle}{
\par This metal urn is identical in appearance to an efreeti bottle, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if
 the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a spread of 50 feet in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke spreads another 10 feet per round until it has spread 100 feet. This area remains smoke-fi
lled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered. The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally.

\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Eyes of Charming}{
\par These two crystal lenses fit over the user\rquote s eyes. The wearer is able to charm person (one target per round) merely by meeting a target\rquote 
s gaze. Those failing a Will saving throw (DC 16) are charmed as per the spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10.

\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Eyes of Doom}{
\par These crystal lenses fit over the user\rquote s eyes, enabling the user to cast doom
 upon those around him or her (one target per round) merely by meeting their gaze. Those failing a Will saving throw (DC 11) are doomed as per the spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10. However, if the wearer 
has both lenses, the user gains the additional power of continual deathwatch vision and can enact an eyebite (DC 19) once per week.

\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Eyes of the Eagle}{
\par These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. These lenses grant a +5 circumstance bonus to Spot checks. Wearing only one of the pair causes a character to become dizzy and, in effect, stunned for 1 round. Therea
fter, the wearer can use the single lens without being stunned so long as the character covers his or her other eye. Of course, the wearer can remove the single lens and see normally at any time, or wear both lenses to end or avoid the dizziness.
\par Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, clairaudience/clairvoyance; Market Price: 1,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Eyes of Petrification}{
\par These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. They allow the wearer to use a petrification gaze attack (DC 19), such as that of a basilisk, for 10 rounds per day. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.

\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Feather Token}{
\par Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The types of tokens are described below. Each token is usable but once.
\par Anchor: A token useful to moor a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to one day.
\par Bird: A token that can be used to deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated target as would a carrier pigeon. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.
\par Fan: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to
 propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be u
sed up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.
\par Swan Boat: A token that forms a huge swanlike boat capable of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear or thirty-two Medium-size characters or any equivalent combination. The boat lasts for one day.
\par Tree: A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (6-foot-diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.
\par Whip: A token that forms into a huge leather whip and wields itself against any opponent desired just like a dancing weapon. The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of base damage, has a +1 enhancement bonus to attacks and damage, and a 
makes a free grapple attack (at a +15 attack bonus) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour.

\par 
\par Figurines of Wondrous Power}{
\par Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous power appears to be a tiny statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the cor
rect command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner.
\par If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.
\par }{\cs19\i Bronze Griffon}{
\par When animated, the bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its poss
essor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette.
\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Market Price: 10,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i Ebony Fly}{
\par When animated, the ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a hippogriff (Hit Dice, AC, carrying capacity, speed, and so on) but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times pe
r week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette.
\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Market Price: 10,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i Golden Lions}{
\par These come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for one full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking 
the command word.
\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Market Price: 16,500 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i Ivory Goats}{
\par These come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:
\par The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a draft horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each week-continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 
hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used. 
\par The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of
 a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4/1d8+4). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add +6 points of damage to each successful attack on that round). It can be called to life
 just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. 
\par The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrierlike mount, with the statistics of a light warhorse (but hairier). However, its rider can employ the goat\rquote 
s horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (DC 16). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per us
e. 
\par After three uses, each of the ivory goats loses its magical ability forever.
\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Market Price: 21,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i Marble Elephant}{
\par This is the largest of the figurines, the statuett
e being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine\rquote 
s owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant.
\par The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.
\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Market Price: 17,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i Obsidian Steed}{
\par An obsidian steed appear
s to be a small, nearly shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the follo
w
ing additional powers usable once per round at will: fly, plane shift, and etherealness. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry the rider to the Lower Planes and then return to
 
its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when the obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his or her gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other plan
es via this means.
\par Caster Level: 15th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, fly, plane shift, etherealness; Market Price: 28,500 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i Onyx Dog}{

\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Market Price: 15,500 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i Serpentine Owl}{
\par A serpentine owl becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl, according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous ho
urs. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all of its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing its owner of all it sees and hears. (Remember the limitations of its Intel
ligence.)
\par Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects; Market Price: 9,100 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i Silver Raven}{
\par This figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its silver consistency, which gives it a hardness of 10). Another 
command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an animal messenger spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It 
can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.

\par On command, one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand. While stored the
 item has negligible weight.  With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove can only store one item at a time. Storing or retrieving an item is a free action.  The item is held in stasis and shrunk down so small within the palm
 of the glove that it cannot be seen.  If the effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears instantly. The creation process yields only one glove.

\par Handy Haversack}{
\par A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary.  It has two side pouches, each of which appears large e
nough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material equal to as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 po
unds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.
\par While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power in addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no d
igging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a free action. The handy haversack and whatever it contains gain a +2 resistance bonus to all saving throws.

\par Helm of Brilliance}{
\par This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a ne

\par Ruby\tab \tab Wall of fire
\par Fire opal\tab Fireball (10d6)
\par Opal\tab \tab Light
\par The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all of its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated:
\par It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes pain and 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.
\par The wearer may command any weapon he or she wields to become a flaming weapon (see above). This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. 

\par Each round, the helm absorbs the first 30 points of fire damage the wearer would otherwise take. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources. 
\par Once all of its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses all its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.
\par If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magic fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional Will saving throw (DC 15), the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate.

\par Horn of Blasting}{
\par This horn can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it has the following effects, both of which happen at once:
\par A 100-foot cone of sound issues forth from the horn. All within this area must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 16). Those who succeed are stunned for 1 round and deafened for 2 ro
unds. Those failing the saving throw take 1d10 points of damage, are stunned for 2 rounds, and are deafened for 4 rounds. 
\par An ultrasonic wave 1 foot wide and 100 feet long issues from the horn. The wave weakens such materials as metal, stone, and wood. This effect deals 1d10 points of damage to objects within the area, ignoring their hardness. 
\par If a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 10% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 5d10 points of damage to the person sounding it.

\par This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner\rquote 
s alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If the owner is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against evil. 
If the owner is evil, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against good. In either case, this ward lasts for 10 rounds. The horn can be blown once per day.

\par Horn of the Tritons}{
\par This device is a conch shell that can be blown once per day (except by a triton, who can sound it three times per day). A horn of the tritons can do any one of the following functions when blown:
\par Calm rough waters in a one-mile radius. This dispels a summoned water elemental if it fails its Will saving throw (DC 16). 
\par Attract 5d4 Large sharks (a 01-30 result on d%), 5d6 Medium-size sharks (31-80), or 1d10 sea lions (81-1
00) if the character is in a body of water in which such creatures dwell. The creatures are friendly and obey, to the best of their ability, the one who sounded the horn. 
\par Panic and demoralize aquatic creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 within 500 feet as if they had been targeted by a fear spell (DC 16). Those who do save are shaken for 3d6 rounds. 
\par Any sounding of a horn of the tritons can be heard by all tritons within a three-mile radius.

 grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone to keep it safe, but the character loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have an AC of 24, 10 hit points, and a hardness of 5.

\par Regeneration from the pearly white Ioun stone only cures damage taken while the character is using the stone. The pale lavender and lavender and green stones work like a rod of absorption, but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones

s face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch att
ack against the target. If it succeeds, the target must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 20) or be struck dead, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds at his or her saving throw, the target nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of d

\par Mirror of Life Trapping}{
\par This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be affixed to a surface and activated by giving a command word. The
 same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has from thirteen to eighteen nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its reflection must make a Will save (DC
 
19) or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creat
ure is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it.
\par When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim\rquote 
s equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror\rquote s owner knows the right command word, the owner can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage the powerless prisoner in co
nversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.
\par If the mirror\rquote s capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in o
rder to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed and usually promptly attack the possessor of the device in revenge for their imprisonment.

\par Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the owner is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language. 
\par Scry with it as if it were a crystal ball, able to view even into other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them. 
\par Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first scries the place normally and then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. An invisible portal remains on the other side where the user arrives, and he or she can return through t
hat portal. Once the user returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if he or she is still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or
 greater might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror. 
\par Once per week the mirror accurately an\-swers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface.

comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disap

s on for 1d10 rounds.
\par As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally silent area, he or she takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 2d4 rounds. During this time, 
damage from sonic attacks, such as sound burst, is doubled. Thereafter, the least noise causes an affected character to wince, giving the character a -2 penalty to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws (except when  in a totally silent area). This
 hypersensitivity is a curse and can be removed by any spell or item that remove curses.

here is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a Perform (pan pipes) check (DC 10). Success means that they obey the piper\rquote 
s telepathic commands so long as the piper continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. If they are called again within a day, the Perform check is against DC 15.

\par A portable hole is a circle of magic cloth. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded

. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains.
\par The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium-size creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth do
es not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth ar

\par Scarab of Protection}{
\par This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a beetle. It gives off a faint magical aura. If it is held for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective device.
\par The scarab\rquote 
s possessor gains spell resistance 15. The scarab can also absorb up to twelve energy-draining attacks or death effects. (An attack that would bestow two negative levels counts as two attacks.) However, upon absorbing twelve such attacks, the sc
arab turns to powder and is destroyed.
\par Caster Level: 18th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, bless, death ward, negative energy protection, and wish or miracle; Market Price: 38,000 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Scarab, Golembane}{
\par This beetle-shaped pin enables its wea
rer to detect any golem within 60 feet, although the wearer must concentrate in order for the detection to take place. Furthermore, the scarab enables its possessor to combat a golem with weapons or unarmed attacks as if the golem had no damage reduction.
 Each scarab has this effect with regard to a different sort of golem.
\par Caster Level: 8th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, detect magic, and keen edge or holy power; Market Price: 800 gp (flesh), 1,000 gp (clay), 1,200 gp (stone), 1,600 gp (iron), 1,800 gp (flesh and clay), or 2,500 gp (any golem); Weight: -.

\par Slippers of Spider Climbing}{
\par When worn, a pair of these slippers enable movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer\rquote s hands free. The wearer\rquote s speed is 15 fee
t. Extremely slippery surfaces-icy, oiled, or greased surfaces-make these slippers useless.
\par Caster Level: 4th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, spider climb; Market Price: 2,000 gp; Weight: 1/2 lb.
\par 
\par }{\cs19\i Sovereign Glue}{
\par Because of its particular powers, this 
viscous substance can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of oil of slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the oil of slipperiness must be put in the flask wit
hin 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8-1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask\rquote 
s capacity taken up by the oil of slipperiness.
\par One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart before that time has elapsed, that application o
f the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects only results in the rending of one or the other, except when universal solvent is applied to the bond. (Sovereign glue is d
issolved by universal solvent.)
\par Caster Level: 20th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, make whole; Market Price: 2,400 gp (per ounce); Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Stone of Alarm}{
\par This stone cube, when given the command word, affixes itself to any object. If that object is 
touched thereafter by anyone who does not first speak that same command word, the stone emits a piercing screech for 1 hour that can be heard up to a quarter-mile away (assuming no intervening barriers).
\par Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, alarm; Market Price: 1,000 gp; Weight: 2 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals}{
\par The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summon
er if earth, mud, or clay is available. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak, and in all ways the stone functions as the summon monster VII spell. (If sand or rough, unhewn stone is the summoning medium, the elemental that comes is Large inst
e
ad, and the stone functions as the summon monster VI spell.) The area of summoning for an earth elemental must be at least 4 feet square and have a volume of 4 cubic yards. The elemental appears in 1d4 rounds. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time.
 A new elemental requires a new patch of earth or stone, which cannot be accessed until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).
\par Caster Level: 13th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI, summon monster VII; Market Price: 100,000 gp; Weight: 5 lb.

\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Stone Horse}{
\par Each item of this nature appears to be a full-sized, roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if i
t were a real horse of the appropriate type.
\par A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first using a stone to flesh spell, thus causing the stone horse to become a normal horse th
at can be healed normally. When fully healed, it automatically reverts to its stone form. While in its stone form, it can be fed gemstones, healing 1 point of damage for each 50 gp worth of mineral it is given.
\par There are two sorts of stone horses:
\par Courser: This stone horse has all the same statistics as a heavy horse, as well as having a hardness of 10. 
\par Destrier: This stone horse has all the same statistics as a heavy warhorse, as well as having a hardness of 10. 
\par Caster Level: 14th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, flesh to stone, animate objects; Market Price: 10,000 gp (courser) or 14,800 gp (destrier); Weight: 6,000 lb.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Stone Salve}{
\par This strange ointment has two uses. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a petrified creature, it returns the c
reature to flesh (as the spell stone to flesh). If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a nonpetrified creature, it protects the creature as a stoneskin spell.
\par Caster Level: 13th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, flesh to stone, stoneskin; Market Price: 4,000 gp per ounce; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Sustaining Spoon}{
\par If this ordinary looking spoon is placed in an empty con\-tainer the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although this substance has a flavor similar to that of warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nou
rishing and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.
\par Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, create food and water; Market Price: 5,500 gp; Weight: -.
\par }{\cs19\i 
\par Talisman of the Sphere}{
\par This small adamantine loop and handle are useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a 
talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a sphere of annihilation, a talisman of the sphere doubles the bonus for Intelligence and level for determining control.
\par If the wielder of a talisman esta
blishes control, the weilder need check for continual control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward the weilder. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of an
nihilation, the talisman\rquote s power of control can be suppressed or canceled.

\par Universal Solvent}{
\par This strange liquid appears to be some sort of minor oil or potion and always comes in
 containers of 1 ounce. Upon first examination, it seems to have the properties of oil of slipperiness. However, if it is applied to any form of adhesive or sticky material, the solution immediately dissolves the other material. It immediately negates the
 effect of sovereign glue, as well as any other form of cement, glue, or adhesive. An ounce affects 1 cubic foot.
\par If the liquid is carefully distilled to bring it down to one-third of its original volume, each dose (1/3 ounce, having been a full ounce befor
e distillation) dissolves 1 cubic foot of organic or inorganic material, just as if a disintegrate spell had been employed. To find out if a resisting target is affected by this concentrated solution, a touch attack roll is required, and the subject is en
titled to a Fortitude saving throw (DC 19).

4 competence bonus to Open Lock checks. If the lockpicks are separated by more than 15 feet from the vest, they lose their competence bonus, but the bonus returns when they are returned to the pockets of the vest. Further, the vest grants the wearer a +6

d, the random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just like a portable hole. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily as from the initiating place. (It is a two-way portal.)
