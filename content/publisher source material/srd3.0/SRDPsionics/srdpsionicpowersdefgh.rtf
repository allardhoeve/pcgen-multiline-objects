ing, the manifester\rquote s Remote View check is opposed by the opponent\rquote s Scry check.) If the manifester at least matches the remote viewer\rquote s result, the manifester gets a visual image of the remote viewer and a sense of the remote viewer

\par The manifester creates a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes.
\par This power should be manifested only while the manifester is on the Ethereal or Astral Plane. 
\par At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1 foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 10 feet per manifester level. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn\rquote 
t really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases dramatically to only 1/2 inch in radius per week (just over 2 feet per year).
\par The environment within the demiplane is determined by the manif
ester when genesis is first manifested, reflecting most any desire the psion can visualize, as long as the DM approves (although no environmental effect within the plane can duplicate effects greater than those of 3rd-level powers). Factors such as solid 
g
round, air, water, and temperature must be determined by the manifester. This power cannot create life, nor can it create construction; such particulars must be introduced to the demiplane in some other fashion. All demiplanes created with genesis are in 
contact with the Astral and Ethereal Planes.
\par Antigenesis: It is possible to manifest genesis on normal planes and demiplanes, but only the most perverse or evil shaper would consider doing so. If genesis is manifested within a normal plane or demiplane, the
 power takes effect according to the speed noted above; however, the energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a growing dead spot like on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot utt
e
rly wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level plain of inert dust. Living things that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly harmed. But plants can find no sustena
n
ce in the dust of the dead spot, marine creatures die even more quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area alone. An antigenesis wave dies out after 100d10 years, or can be canceled by yet another manifestation of g
enesis.

\par The manifester permanently attaches any weapon\emdash mundane, psionic, or magical\emdash onto the end of one of his or her arms. The weapon becomes a natural extension of the arm, and that hand is nowhere to be seen. If the character is prof
icient with the weapon, he or she adds +1 to all attack and damage rolls while using the weapon (this stacks with all other bonuses, including those granted by Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization). The grafted weapon becomes subject to powers that norm
ally do not effect equipment, such as expansion. More importantly, since the weapon is a natural part of the character\rquote s body, powers that normally only enhance unarmed attacks and touch attacks now apply to the grafted weapon.
\par However, the character loses the use of one hand and receives a \endash 
2 competence penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorphose the character (or just his or her hands) can ignore the grafted weapon or alter it normally, at the manifester\rquote 
s discretion. If the weapon takes damage, the character takes the damage as well. If the character is healed, so is the grafted weapon. If the weapon is destroyed, the character loses 2 points of Constitution; the ability damage persists until th
e character can graft another weapon or restore his or her natural anatomy (see below).
\par A character can change out weapons by using this power again. If the character manifests this power without any weapon, his or her natural anatomy returns (but the character can\rquote t use this power to recover a limb lost through some other mishap).

\par A grease power covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the power is manifested must make a successf
ul Reflex save or slip, skid, and fall. Those who successfully save can move at half speed across the surface. However, those who remain in the area must each make a new saving throw each round to avoid falling and to be able to move. The DM should adjust
 saving throws by circumstance.
\par The power can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this power, while objects wielded or employed by creatures receive a Reflex save to avoid the effect. If the
 initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.

within 15 feet of the primary foe, or who subsequently move within 15 feet of the primary foe while the duration lasts. Secondary foes also take 6d6 points of damage per round the duration lasts. Should either the primary or secondary foe fall to below 0

\par The manifester can control the actions of any humanoid of Medium-size or smaller. The manifester establishes a telepathic link with the subject\rquote 
s mind. If the manifester can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of the subject\rquote 
s abilities, regardless of whether the manifester shares a language with the subject. The manifester knows what the subject is experiencing but does not receive direct sensory input from him or her.
\par Subjects resist this control, and those forced to tak
e actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is un
limited, as long as the manifester and subject are on the same plane. The manifester need not see the subject to control it.
\par Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent the manifester from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or negate it.
