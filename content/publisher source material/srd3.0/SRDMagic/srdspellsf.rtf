\par Saving Throw: None
\par Spell Resistance: No
\par The character conjures up a phantom watchdog that is invisi

 conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions. It is stationary.
\par If an intruder approache
s to within 5 feet of the watchdog, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature. (For most defenders, the invisible creatur
e gets a +2 attack bonus and the defender loses any Dexterity bonus to AC.) The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder\rquote 
s turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a +3 weapon for purposes of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.
\par The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If the character is ever more than 100 feet distant from the watchdog, the spell ends.

\par Area: 20-ft.-radius spread

\par Spell Resistance: Yes
\par A fireball spell is a burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

\par The character determines the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the character and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier pri
or to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point (an early impact results in an early detonation). If the character attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, the character must "hit" t
he opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
\par The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, o
r bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

\par Acorn Grenades: Up to four acorns turn into special grenadelike weapons that can be hurled up to 100 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Each acorn bursts upon striking any hard surface. Togethe

 creature within the burst area makes a successful Reflex saving throw, it takes only half damage; a creature struck directly always sustains full damage (no saving throw).
\par Holly Berry Bombs: The character turns up to eight holly berries into special bombs.
 The holly berries are usually placed by hand, being too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). They burst into flame if the character is within 200 feet and speak a word of command. The berries instantly ignite, causing 
1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to creatures and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. Creatures who successfully make Reflex saving throws take half damage.

\par Fire trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap wards. The fire trap can ward any closeable item. When casting fire trap, the character selects a point on the item as the spell\rquote 
s center. When someone other than the character opens the item, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell\rquote s center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster l
evel (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.
\par The fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.
\par A knock spell does not affect a fire trap in any way, because knock only opens things and the fire trap in no way prevents one from opening the trapped item. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.
\par Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
\par As the caster, the character can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast. "Attuning" to an individual usually involves a password that the character can share with friends.

 means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The sphere winks o

\par Freezing sphere is a multipurpose spell. The character can cast any one of the following three versions:
\par Frigid Sphere: A tiny sphere of freezing matter steaks from the character's fingertips to up to long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level) to strike a body 
of water or a liquid that is principally water. When it strikes such a target, it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10-foot square) per caster level. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. The sphere 
h
as no effect if it strikes a creature, even a water-based creature, but creatures swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must succeed at a Strength check (DC 2
5) to do so.
\par Cold Ray: A ray of cold springs from the character's hand to close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels). The character must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit the character's target. The ray instantaneously deals 1d6 points of cold damage per
 caster level (maximum 20d6).
\par Globe of Cold: The character creates a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch but not harmful. This globe is a grenadelike weapon and can be hurled either as a thrown weapon (range increment 20 feet) or
 in a sling. The globe bursts on impact, dealing 6d6 points of cold damage instantaneously to all targets within a 10-foot radius. Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves for half damage. If the character does not hurl the globe, it bursts on its own 
after 1 round per caster level. The character can command the globe to burst sooner if the character wishes, but the time cannot be changed once set (though it still bursts on impact after being hurled).
