\par }{The character determines the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glow
ing, pea-sized bead travels the distance from the character and can detonate immediately (the same round as the spell was cast) if the character desires, or the character can choose to delay the burst for up to 5 rounds. The character chooses the amount o
f
 delay upon completing the spell, and the delay cannot change once it has been set (unless someone touches the bead; see below). If the bead impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, bursts into the fireball at
 that point (an early impact results in an early detonation).
\par If the character chooses a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up
 and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while the creature is handling it.
\par If the character attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage the character must "hit" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
\par The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals wit
h a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier.

s ability to react is limited normally by its Intelligence. The message can also contain a suggestion, which the subject does its best to carry out. A suggestion recommends a course of activity
 (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.  The suggested course of activity can continue for 1hour/level of the caster. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter
 
time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. The character can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity is not perfor
med.

\par The character can detect a particular type of animal or plant in a quarter circle emanating out from the character in whatever direction the character faces. The character must think of a spe
cies of animal or plant when using the spell. Each round the character can change the animal or plant type. The amount of information revealed depends on how long the character searches a particular area or focus on a specific type of animal or plant:

\par 1st Round: Presence or absence of the animal or plant type in that quarter.
\par 2nd Round: Number of individuals of the specified type in the area, and the condition of the healthiest specimen.
\par 3rd Round: The condition and location of each individual present. If an animal or plant is outside the character's line of sight, then the character discerns its direction but not its exact location.
\par Conditions: For purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows:
\par Normal: Has at least 90% of original hit points, free of disease.
\par Fair: 30% to 90% of original hit points remaining.
\par Poor: Up to 30% of original hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury.
\par Weak: 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease in the terminal stage, or crippled.
\par If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of the two.
\par Note: Each round the character can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
\par The DM decides if a specific type of animal or plant is present.

\par 1st Round: Presence or absence of undead auras.
\par 2nd Round: Number of undead auras in the area and the strength of the strongest undead aura present. If the character is of good alignment, the strongest undead aura\rquote

ies of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster\rquote s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can\rquote 
t be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells. Dispel magic affects spell-like effects just as it affects spells.
\par Note: The effects of spells with instantaneous duration can\rquote t be dispelled, because the magic effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.
\par The character choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
\par Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is 
the target of the spell. The character makes a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 +1 per caster level (maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the spell\rquote 
s caster level.
\par If the spellcaster targets an object or creature who is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), she makes a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
\par If the object that the character targets is a magic item, the character makes a dispel check against the item\rquote s caster level. If the character succeeds, all the item\rquote 
s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface is temporarily closed. Remember that a magic item\rquote 
s physical properties are unchanged. Artifacts and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
\par The character automatically succeeds at the dispel check against any spell that the character cast.
\par Area Dispel: The spell affects everything within a 30-foot radius.
\par For each creature who is the target of one or more spells, the character makes a dispel check
 against the spell with the highest caster level. If that fails, the character makes dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until the character dispels one spell (which discharges the dispel so far as that target is concerned) or fail all the c
haracter's checks. The creature\rquote s magic items are not affected.
\par For each object that is the target of one or more spells, the character makes dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by area dispels.
\par For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the dispel magic\rquote s area, the character makes a dispel check to dispel the spell.
\par For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel, the character makes a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the area of the dispel magic.
\par If an object or creature who is the effect of an ongoing spell, such as a monster summoned by monster summoning, is in the area, the character makes a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature (returning it whence it came) in
 addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.
\par The character may choose to automatically succeed at dispel checks against any spell that the character cast.
\par Counterspell: The spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work. The character must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster\rquote s spell.

\par Casting Time: 10 minutes
\par Range: Personal
\par Target: The character
\par Duration: Instantaneous
\par This divination 
spell can provide the character with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme
 or omen.
\par In all cases, the DM controls what information the character receives. Note that if the character's party doesn\rquote t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful.
\par The base chance for a correct divinati
on is 70% + 1% per caster level. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, the character knows the spell failed, unless specific 
magic yielding false information is at work.
\par Multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination and yield the same answer each time.
\par Material Component: Worth at least 25 gp.

lating objects with its paws and mouth. The character need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the animal unless the character is trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn\rquote t do.

\par The character, or a messenger touched by the character, sends a phantasmal message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, the characte
r must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to his or her identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient\rquote 
s dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. 
\par The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the messenger\rquote 
s mind returns instantly to his or her body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient\rquote s dream and deliver the message.
\par If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient\rquote 
s dream and deliver the message as normal. If the messenger is disturbed during the trance, the messenger awakens, and the spell ends.
\par Creatures who don\rquote t sleep or dream cannot be contacted by this spell.
\par The messenger is unaware of his or her own surroundings or the activities around him or her while in the trance. The messenger is defenseless, both physically and mentally (always fails any saving throw, for example) while in the trance.
