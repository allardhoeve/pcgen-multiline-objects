\par Target: One chest and up to 1 cu. ft. of goods/caster level
\par Duration: 60 days or until discharged
\par Saving Throw: None
\par Spell Resistance: No
\par The character hides a chest on the Ethereal Plane for up to 60 days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest\rquote 
s actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, the
re is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, the character can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to the character.
\par The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for 
the character by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the character must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a 
perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) The character can have but one pair of these chests at any given time\emdash 
even wishes do not allow exceptions. The chests themselves are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.
\par To hide the chest, the character casts the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. The character needs the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per 
day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although it could be found by going to the Ethereal Plane. 
\par Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally; and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.
\par Focus: The chest and its replica.

\par When the character casts sepia snake sigil, a small symbol appears i
n the text of one written work, such as a book, scroll, or map.  The text containing the symbol must be t least twenty-five words long.  Then anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided 
there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.  Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read the text.  The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake\rquote 
s strike. If it succeeds, 
the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at the character's c
ommand or when 1d4 days +1 day per caster level have elapsed.
\par While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. The subject is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of his or h
er surroundings. The subject can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides the subject with no protection against physical injury. However, if the subject is reduced to \endash 1 to \endash 
9 hit points, the subject does not lose hit points or stabilize until the spell ends.
\par The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove the sigil. An erase spell destroys the entire page of text. Sep
ia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text.
\par Material Components: Worth at least 500 gp.

\par To use the shadow walk spell, the character must be in an area of heavy shadows. The character and any creature the character touches are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of 
Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. The character can take more than one creature along with the character (subject to the character's level limit), but all must be touching each other.
\par In the region of shadow, the character 
can move at a rate of up to seven miles every 10 minutes, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, a character can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shad
ow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. The character knows where the character will come out on the Material Plane.
\par Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this
 requires the potentially perilous transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
\par Any creatures touched by the character when shadow walk is cast also make the tran
sition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow the character, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by the character). Creatur
es unwilling to accompany the character into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

\par The caster can assume the form of any single creature of less than deity status or any single object. The assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no larger than 200 feet in its largest dimension. This spell allows incorporeal forms to be assumed.

\par Upon changing, the character regains lost hit points as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting for a day; and changing b
ack does not heal the caster further). If slain, the character reverts to his or her original form, though the character remains dead.
\par The polymorphed character acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature he or she has been polymorphed into
 while retaining his or her own mind. The character gains the type of the new form.  Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include armor, attack routines and similar gross physical qual
i
ties. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, but not magical flight and other magical forms of travel. Extremely high speeds for certain creatures are the result of magical ability, so they are not granted by this spell. Other nonma
gical abilities (such as low-light vision) are considered natural abilities and are retained.
\par Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole remains polymorphed.
\par The character\rquote s new scores and faculties are average ones for the race or species into which he or she has been transformed. 
\par The character retains his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in the character\rquote s Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, an
d base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The character retains his or her extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities. The character can ca
s
t spells for which he or she has components. The character needs a humanlike voice for verbal components and humanlike hands for somatic components. The caster does not gain the spell-like abilities of the new form. The character does not gain the superna
tural abilities of the new creature.  The character does gain the extraordinary abilities of the new form.
\par When the polymorph occurs, the character\rquote s equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature that does not use equipm
ent, the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. Material components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast spells. If the new form uses equipment, the caster\rquote 
s equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties.
\par The character can freely designate the new form\rquote s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form\rquote 
s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under the character's control, but must fall within the norms for the new form\rquote 
s species. The character can be changed into a member of his or her own species or even into itself. (If changed into itself, it does not suffer the abovementioned penalties from the disorientation of a new form.)
\par The character is effectively disguised as an average member of the new form\rquote s race. If the character uses this spell to create a disguise, the character gets a +10 bonus on the character's Disguise check.
\par The character can become just about anything the character is familiar with. The character can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before the character's regular action or immediately after it,
 but not during the action.  The character regains hit points as if having rested for a day only from the initial transformation, however.

 make a Disguise check when the character casts the spell to determine how good the likeness is.
\par At all times the simulacrum remains under the character's absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner
. The simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 1 day, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipp

\par Saving Throw: None
\par Spell Resistance: No
\par This spell enables the character to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The s
nare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When the character casts snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Search check for a rogue [only] to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts ar
ound one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. (Note that the head of a worm or a snake could be thus ensnared.)
\par If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then st
raighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, causing no damage but tig
htly binding it.
\par An entangled creature suffers a \endash 2 penalty to attack rolls and suffers a \endash 4 penalty to effective Dexterity. If the snare is anchored to an immobile object, the entangled character cannot move. Otherwise, the creature can move at half speed,
 but can\rquote t run or charge. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by this spell must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell.
\par The snare is magical. To escape, the trapped creature must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 23) or 
a Strength check (DC 23) that is a full-round action. The snare has 5 hit points and AC 7. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.

i
ts attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds). It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so it can strike incorporeal creatures. The weapon always strikes from the character's direction. It does not get a flanking bo
n
us or help a combatant get one. The character's feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of the character's sight, or if the character is not directing it, the weapon returns to the charac

\par Each round after the first, the character can use a standard action to switch the weapon to a new target. If the character does not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round\rquote s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, i
t gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if the character's base attack bonus would allow it to. The spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or damaged.
\par If an attacked creature has SR, the resistan
ce is checked the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

\par The character brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as the character desires, starting the round

\par Level: Clr 8, Sor/Wiz 8
\par Components: V, S, M/DF (or V, S, M for carefully engraved)
\par Casting Time: 1 action or 10 minutes
\par Range: 0 ft.
\par Effect: One symbol
\par Duration: See text
\par Saving Throw: See text
\par Spell Resistance: Yes
\par This spell allows the character to scribe any of the potent runes described below. A symbol can be quickly scribed in the air or on some surface. Alternatively, the character can carefully inscribe it on a surface. The symbol harms those who trigger it.

\par A quickly scribed symbol has a casting time of 1 action. The resulting rune becomes active immediately. It lasts 10 minutes per caster level and
 glows faintly while it lasts. Symbols of fear, hopelessness, pain, or persuasion can be used in this manner. Symbols of death, discord, insanity, pain, sleep, and stunning cannot.
\par A carefully engraved symbol has a casting time of 10 minutes. The symbol is
 inactive when finished and remains so until triggered. Once triggered, it becomes active and glows, usually lasting 10 minutes per caster level. Some symbols can last indefinitely once triggered.
\par To be effective, a symbol must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol ineffective.
\par As a default, a symbol is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as the character selects: reads, touches, or passes over the rune, looks at the rune, or passes through a portal bearing the rune.
\par In this case, "reading" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify i
t, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol to render it inoperative triggers it if it reacts to touch. To trigger a symbol, a creature must be within 60 feet of the rune.
\par The character can set special triggering conditions of the character's own. These can be as simple or elaborate as the character desires. Special conditions for triggering a symbol can be based on a creature\rquote 
s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don\rquote t qualify.
\par A symbol\rquote s triggering conditions must always be defensive in nature. A touch-triggered symbol remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol cannot be placed on
 a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
\par Once the spell is cast, a symbol\rquote s triggering conditions cannot be changed.
\par The character ignore the effects of the character's own symbols and cannot inadvertently trigger them. When scribing a 
symbol quickly, the character can instantly attune any number of creatures to the symbol, rending them immune to its effects, provided the creatures are within 60 feet of the rune when it is created and that the character is aware of their presence.

\par When c
reating a carefully inscribed symbol, the character can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol. The character also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol, but doing this can extend the casting t
i
me. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (up to ten creatures) takes 1 hour. Attuning a large group (up to twenty-five creatures) takes 1 day. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees f
it.
\par When triggered, a symbol affects all creatures within a 60-foot radius except for the character and any individuals attuned to it. If a symbol has a password, anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\rquote 
s effects so long as the char
acter remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the character leaves the radius and returns later, the character must use the password again. Once triggered, a symbol remains active until its duration expires. Creatures who subsequently meet an active symbol
\rquote s triggering conditions suffer its effects.
\par A successful dispel magic removes the effects of a symbol from a creature unless the symbol\rquote s effect is instantaneous or the description specifies another remedy. The rune itself can be removed by a successful di
spel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol. Destruction of the surface where a symbol rests destroys the symbol but also triggers its effects.
\par Read magic allows the character to identify a symbol with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 19). Identifying the symbol does not discharge it and allows the character to know the version of the symbol.
\par A symbol can be rendered permanent with the permanency spell, provided it is carefully engraved upon a permanent, nonportable surface such as a wall or door. A permanency spell extends a symbol\rquote 
s basic duration of 10 minutes per caster level indefinitely. When triggered, a permanent symbol usually glows and is active for about 10 minutes, but there is no limit to how many times it c
an be triggered. If the symbol can affect only a limited number of hit points worth of creatures, the limit applies each 10 minutes.
\par Known symbols include:
\par Death: One or more creatures within the radius, whose combined total hit points do not exceed 150, m
ust succeed at Fortitude saves or die. The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts until it has affected 150 h
it points worth of creatures.
\par Discord: All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who fail a Will save immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have diffe
rent alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d4 rounds. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 mi
nutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
\par Fear: This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. Living creatures within the radius become panicked. They suffer a \endash 2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee 
from the area. A panicked creature has a 50% chance to drop what it\rquote s holding, chooses its path randomly (as long as it is getting away from immediate danger), and flees any other dangers that confront it. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers.

\par If scribed in the air, this symbol requires a Will save to resist. If the rune is carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
\par Hopelessness: All creatures with
in the radius must attempt Will saves. If the rune is carefully engraved on a surface, the save DC increases by 4. If the save fails, the creature suffers from hopelessness for 3d4x10 minutes and submits to simple, demands from foes, such as to surrender 
o
r get out.  If no foes are present to make demands, there is a 25% chance that a hopeless creature proves unable to take any action except hold its ground. If the creature remains free to act, there is a 25% chance it retreats from the rune at normal spee
d. In either case, the creature can defend normally if attacked. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
\par Insanity: One or more creatures within the radius, whose combined total hit points do not exceed 150, become insane (Will negates)
\par Creatures affected behave randomly, as indicated on the following table:
\par 1d10 \tab Behavior
\par ---- \tab --------
\par 1 \tab Wander away for 1 minute (unless prevented)
\par 2\endash 6 \tab Do nothing for 1 round
\par 7\endash 9 \tab Attack nearest creature for 1 round
\par 10 \tab Act normally for 1 round
\par Except on a result of 1, roll again each round to see what the subject does that round. Wandering creatures leave the scene as if disinterested. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking them. Behavior is ch
ecked at the beginning of each creature\rquote s turn. Any creature who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn.
\par Remove curse does not remove insanity. Greater restoration, limited wish, miracle, and wish can restore the creature.
\par The sym
bol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts until it has affected 150 hit points worth of creatures. This version is 
a mind-affecting spell.
\par Pain: Creatures within the radius suffer wracking pains that reduce Dexterity scores by 2 and impose a \endash 4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks (Fortitude negates). Both effects last 2d10x10 minutes. This symbol c
an be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. If carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level.
\par Persuasion: This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. A
ll creatures within the radius must succeed at Will saves to resist. If the symbol is carefully inscribed, the save DC increases by 4. If the save fails, the creature becomes the same alignment as the character for 1d20 x 10 minutes. During this time, aff
ected creatures become friendly to the character. 
\par The spell does not enable the character to control the creatures as if they were automatons, but the creatures p
erceive the character's words and actions in the most favorable way. The character can try to give the creatures orders, but the character must win an opposed Charisma check to convince the creatures to do anything they wouldn\rquote 
t ordinarily do. (Retries not
 allowed.) The creatures never obey suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by the character or the character's apparent allies that threatens the creatures breaks the spell. Note also that the character must speak the creatures\rquote 
 language to communicate the character's commands, or else be good at pantomiming.
\par This version is a mind-affecting spell.
\par Sleep: Creatures within the radius fall into a catatonic slumber if they have 8 or fewer HD (Will negates). Sleeping creatures cannot be awakened for 3d6x
10 minutes. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level. This version is a mind-affecting spell.
\par Stunning: One or more creatures within the radius whose total hit points do not exceed 250 become stunned (Fortitude negates). The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. A stunned creature can
\rquote t act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack it. In addition, the stunned creatures drop what they are holding. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface.
\par Material Component (carefully scribed version): Worth at least 5,000 gp each.

\par The character causes an 
object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific type of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by the character. The particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically. La
rger groups, such as a \'93type,\'94 are not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named.
\par Creatures of the type or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or to possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the a
rea or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 x 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or objec
