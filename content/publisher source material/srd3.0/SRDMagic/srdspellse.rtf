\par When the character casts earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. It knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The shock lasts 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can
\rquote t move or attack. Spellcasters on the ground must make Concentration checks (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spells they try to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The exact effects d
epend on the terrain and its features:
\par Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex half DC 15). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endang
er those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
\par Cliffs: They crumble, causing a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep 100 feet outward from the base of
 the cliff. Any creature in the path sustains 8d6 points of damage (Reflex half DC 15).
\par Open Ground: All creatures standing in the area must make Reflex saving throws (DC 15) or fall down. Fissures open in the ground, and every creature on the ground has a
 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex save DC 20 to avoid the fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.
\par Structure: Most structures standing on open ground collapse, dealing 8d6 points of damage to those caught within or beneath the rubble (Reflex half DC 15).
\par River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the 
spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Creatures must make Reflex saving throws (DC 15) or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those ca
ught in the mud.

\par The elementals obey the character explicitly and never attack the character, even if someone 
else manages to gain control over them. The character does not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. The character can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.
\par When the character uses a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

\par Magical properties are not increased by this spell. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. A creature\rquote s hit points, Armor Cla
ss, and base attack bonus do not change, but Strength increases along with size. For every 20% of enlargement, the creature gains a +1 enlargement bonus to Strength.
\par Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

\par The character and other creatures joined by linked hands (along with their equipment) become ethereal. Besides the character, the character can bring one creature per three caster levels to the Ethereal Plane.  Once ethereal, the creatures need not stay t
ogether.
\par When the spell expires, all affected creatures in the Ethereal Plane return to material existence. If a character becomes material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), the character is shunted off to the nearest open space and tak
es 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that the character traveled.

\par The character traces these runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The runes detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of damage. Anyo

ng throw).
\par As the spellcaster, the character and any characters the character specifically instructs can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, the character can remove the runes whenever desired. Others can remove them with a su
ccessful dispel magic or erase spell. However, attempting to dispel or erase the runes and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

\par Level: Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 6
\par Components: V, S
\par Casting Time: 1 action
\par Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
\par Target: The character
\par Duration: 1 round/three levels (see text)
\par Saving Throw: See text
\par Spell Resistance: Yes
\par The character can meet the gaze of a creature and speak a single word to affect it with one of four magical 
effects: charm, fear, sicken, or sleep. The character selects one of these four possible gaze attacks when casting the spell. The character retains the gaze power for 1 round for every three caster levels and can use the gaze attack as a free action each 
round.
\par These effects do not affect undead creatures or extend beyond the plane the character currently occupies. The character is subject to the effects of a reflected gaze and is allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected charm gaze, t
he character is held (as a hold monster spell).
\par The four versions of the spell are as follows:
\par Charm: The subject regards the character as a trusted friend and ally. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the character or the character's allies, however, he receives a +5 bonus on his saving throw.
\par The spell does not enable the character to control the charmed creature as if the creature were an automaton, but the subject perceives the character's words and actions in the most favorable
 way. The character can try to give the subject orders, but the character must win an opposed Charisma check to convince the subject to do anything he or she wouldn\rquote 
t ordinarily do. (Retries not allowed.) A charmed creature never obeys suicidal or obviousl
y harmful orders. Any act by the character or the character's apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks the spell. Note also that the character must speak the creature\rquote 
s language to communicate the character's commands, or else be good at pantomiming.
\par Fear: The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. Once it stops fleeing, the creature refuses to face the character for 10 minutes per the character's caster level. If subsequently confronted by the character, it either cowers or bolts f
or the nearest cover (50% chance of either). This is an enchantment, compulsion, mind-affecting effect; it can be negated by a Will save (SR applies).
\par Sicken: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject\rquote s body. An affected creature\rquote s speed is reduced by half, it loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and it suffers a \endash 
2 penalty to attack rolls. The creature remains stricken for 10 minutes per the character's caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse
 or successful dispel magic spell is effective. This is a necromancy effect; it can be negated by a Fortitude save (SR applies).
\par Sleep: The subject falls asleep. The creature sleeps for the character's caster level x 10 minutes but can be slapped awake. This is an enchantment, compulsion, mind-affecting effect; it can be negated by a Will save (SR applies).
\par Note: Each round, a gaze attack automatically works against one creature within range that is looking at (attacking or interacting with) the gazing creature.
