Homebrew Note:

With our ever growing data folder and a growing need to organize the sets for better
maintainability, the following changes WILL impact our homebrew community:

d20ogl folder has been removed, in it's place is now a folder for each gamemode we support. Each
folder should contain sets only for that gamemode, there are a few exceptions.

The format for the data structure is very simple	/gamemode/publisher/book or subcategory

Example of folders in place of d20ogl:
3e
35e
darwins_world_2
pathfinder
etc.

If you have data pointing to any of the core sets, you'll need to correct your full path link
associations. Links are any that have a file path starting at the base data folder -
PCC:@/d20ogl/srd35/xxx.pcc  You won't need to change relative links.

For the main sets the following changes need to be made:
srd				/3e/wizards_of_the_coast/srd/
srd35				/35e/wizards_of_the_coast/srd35/
PF Main Books		/pathfinder/paizo/pathfinder/CORE_BOOK_NAME
PF Adventure Paths	/pathfinder/paizo/adventure_path
PF Campaign Setting	/pathfinder/paizo/campaign_setting
PF Player Companion	/pathfinder/paizo/player_companion

We apologize for the inconvenience this will cause, but think this change will better help for set
maintainability and future improvements as we incorporate new systems.

Any questions or support items, please contact our Support Desk Monkey Andrew Maitland at

Sincerely,
