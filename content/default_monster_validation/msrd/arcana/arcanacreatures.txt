General: "DATA: Feat Pool off" will appear on some entries. These are usually creatures that have multiples of 4 hit dice or get an INT bonus to the feat pool. In modern monsters gain their feats at a rate of 1 per 4 HD after the first, meaning at 5th, 9th, etc. I do have a tracker for that. -- Frank
