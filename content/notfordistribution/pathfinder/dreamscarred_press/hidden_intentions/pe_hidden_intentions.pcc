DESC:Get sneaky with this final serialized release in the Psionics Expanded product line! Are you looking for a stealthy psionic character? Then perhaps the Cryptic is just what you need.

Do you just want to take over the bodies of your enemies? Then the Body Snatcher prestige class is for you! Psionics Expanded: Hidden Intentions is 50 pages of new material for new and existing psionic characters. With new psion advanced discipline, new psychic warrior paths, new wilder surge options, archetypes for every psionic class and even core classes, new psionic feats, psionic powers, and psionic items, there is something for virtually any character with a psychometabolism focus!
