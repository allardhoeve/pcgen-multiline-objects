Mindleap Contingency
	KEY:Mindleap Contingency ~ Body Snatcher

	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural
	DESC:You unlock the ability to use a unique metapsionic effect known as a mindleap contingency.  Powers that specify a single target and can affect your current form can be made into mindleap contingent powers. A mindleap contingent power, once manifest, lies dormant, undetectable and undispellable, for up to five minutes (after which time it fades harmlessly), or until you leave your current body via mind switch (either to return to your original body or to possess another). Immediately after the switch occurs, the mindleap contingency triggers, and the linked power takes effect on the body you were in when you established the contingency. Any choices to be made about the effect must be made when the power is manifest, not when it triggers. Saving throws made against a mindleap contingent power suffer a -5 penalty due to the sudden shift in bodies. Using this ability is akin to using a metapsionic feat - you must expend your psionic focus when establishing a mindleap contingency, and establishing one increases the power's power point cost by 4.

Immediately upon being reduced to -1 hit points or lower, or failing a saving throw against an effect that would kill you, you may expend your psionic focus to manifest true mind switch as an immediate action at the same manifester level you manifest mind switch. You may only target your killer with this effect (thus, if the killer is out of range, this ability is worthless), and the save DC is reduced by 4 due to the desperate nature of this technique. If successful, your mind switches places with your killer's just before dying. You suffer level loss as normal for losing your previous body after a true mind switch.  You may apply all your body snatcher class features (except seal the host) to any manifestation of true mind switch, even one made at the moment of death.

The arrow is identical in all ways (except visually) to an arrow shot from a composite longbow of a size appropriate to you. You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage for attacks made with mind arrows, instead of your Strength modifier. The mind arrow receives all the benefits normally applied to the mind blade, including the ability to use psychic strike, any enhancement bonus or weapon special abilities, or feats that apply to the mind blade, although any melee-specific options are non-functional while in mind arrow form. Ranged feats that apply to ranged attacks, such as Point-Blank Shot, apply to the mind arrow.
