	PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Psionic=6
	DESC:As long as you are maintaining psoinic focus, as an immediate action, you can minimize the damage of a single attack with a ranged, melee, or natural weapon or unarmed strike (treat all dice rolled as 1s) on any member of the collective.

If you spend 4 additional power points, your surge blast deals half damage, but damages all creatures in a 30 ft. line.  4. If you spend 4 additional power points, your surge blast is empowered, dealing 50%% additional damage.  5. If you spend 4 additional power points, your surge blast is a 15 ft. cone effect instead of a ranged touch attack, and creatures in the affected area gain a Reflex save (DC %1) to take half damage.  6.
