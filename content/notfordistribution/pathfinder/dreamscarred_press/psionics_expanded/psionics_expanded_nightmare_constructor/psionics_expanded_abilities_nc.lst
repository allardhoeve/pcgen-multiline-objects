Horror
	KEY:Horror ~ Nightmare Constructor
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural
	DESC:You are able to form a creature created from distilled fears and nightmares.  Creating a horror takes one minute of concentration to complete and the horror remains until dismissed by you.  This horror functions as a summoner's eidolon using your class level as the summoner level, with the following exceptions.  A horror is a mindless construct like an astral construct and not an outsider, so it is subject to effects like dismiss ectoplasm instead of effects like banishment.  Commanding a horror is the same as commanding an astral construct.  A horror disperses if you are rendered unconscious or die.  You can allow your horror to use your terrors, but such uses still count against your daily limit.

Devastating Touch
	KEY:Devastating Touch ~ Nightmare Constructor
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural
	DESC:Your horror gains the devastating touch ability of a dread, using your class level to determine the total damage dealt.  This also allows you to select terrors that modify devastating touch, but these terrors only apply to the horror's use of devastating touch.

Fear Surge
	KEY:Fear Surge ~ Nightmare Constructor
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural
	DESC:When you are within %1 ft. of a creature that suffers from the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, you gain %2 additional evolution points to spend on the horror.  These evolution points only last while there is a creature within %1 ft. of the horror with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition.|FearSurgeRange|FearSurgeEvolutionPoints

Horrific Infusion
	KEY:Horrific Infusion ~ Nightmare Constructor
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural
	DESC:You can merge with your horror as a standard action. You wear the horror like translucent and undulating armor. The horror mimics all of your movements, and you perceive through the horror's senses and speak through its voice, as the two are now one creature. You direct all of the horror's actions while merged. While merged with your horror, you use the horror's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You gain the horror's hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the horror is killed and sent back to its home plane. You use the horror's base attack bonus, and gain the horror's armor and natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. You also gain access to the horror's special abilities and the horror's evolutions. You are still limited to the horror's maximum number of natural attacks. The horror has no skills or feats of its own. The horror must be at least the same size as you. The horror must have limbs for you to cast spells with somatic components (should you have spellcasting ability). While fused, you lose the benefits of your armor. You count both as your original type and as a construct for any effect related to type, whichever is worse for you. Powers such as dismiss ectoplasm work on the horror, but you are unaffected. Neither you nor your horror can be targeted separately, as you are fused into one creature. You and your horror cannot take separate actions. While fused with your horror, you can use all of your own abilities and gear, except for your armor. In all other cases, this ability functions as the normal horror ability.
