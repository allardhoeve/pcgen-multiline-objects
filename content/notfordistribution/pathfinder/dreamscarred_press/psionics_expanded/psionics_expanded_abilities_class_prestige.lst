In addition, while under conceal thoughts, you may emulate the alignment of the subject for purposes of fooling abilities that detect alignment.
	DESC:This extends to include false memories, foiling effects such as mind probe.|PRECLASS:1,Body Snatcher=5

	KEY:Rapid Transfer ~ Body Snatcher

Mindleap Contingency
	KEY:Mindleap Contingency ~ Body Snatcher
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural
	DESC:You unlock the ability to use a unique metapsionic effect known as a mindleap contingency.  Powers that specify a single target and can affect your current form can be made into mindleap contingent powers. A mindleap contingent power, once manifest, lies dormant, undetectable and undispellable, for up to five minutes (after which time it fades harmlessly), or until you leave your current body via mind switch (either to return to your original body or to possess another). Immediately after the switch occurs, the mindleap contingency triggers, and the linked power takes effect on the body you were in when you established the contingency. Any choices to be made about the effect must be made when the power is manifest, not when it triggers. Saving throws made against a mindleap contingent power suffer a -5 penalty due to the sudden shift in bodies. Using this ability is akin to using a metapsionic feat - you must expend your psionic focus when establishing a mindleap contingency, and establishing one increases the power's power point cost by 4.

Greater Melding Exchange
	KEY:Greater Melding Exchange ~ Body Snatcher
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural

You may use the subject's ranks in Knowledge skills in place of your own, and you learns the command words or thoughts for any items the subject has (provided they were known to the subject). Additionally, as a standard action, you may expend your psionic focus to mentally "ask" your newfound memories one question, typically about the subject's past or personality. You learn the answer to that question to the best of the subject's knowledge. Asking about rote facts is often unnecessary, due to the granting of Knowledge ranks - this ability extends beyond the Knowledge skill.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.45

Death Is Only the Beginning
	KEY:Death Is Only the Beginning ~ Body Snatcher
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural
	DESC:Common folklore suggests that many people see their lives flash before their eyes just before they die. In some ways, this is literal truth for you, although you tend to see only opportunity. Immediately upon being reduced to -1 hit points or lower, or failing a saving throw against an effect that would kill you, you may expend your psionic focus to manifest true mind switch as an immediate action at the same manifester level you manifest mind switch. You may only target your killer with this effect (thus, if the killer is out of range, this ability is worthless), and the save DC is reduced by 4 due to the desperate nature of this technique. If successful, your mind switches places with your killer's just before dying. You suffer level loss as normal for losing your previous body after a true mind switch.  You may apply all your body snatcher class features (except seal the host) to any manifestation of true mind switch, even one made at the moment of death.

(A wall of force, wall of fire, wall of ectoplasm, or the like stops a mind arrow.) This ability negates cover and concealment, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.
