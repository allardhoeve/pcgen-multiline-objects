The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in rage, you gain a +%2 morale bonus to your Strength and a +%3 morale bonus to Constitution, as well as a +%4 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, you take a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you %5 hit points, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end your rage as a free action and are fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your rage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death.|RageDuration|RageStrBonus|RageConBonus|RageSaveBonus|(RageConBonus/2)*TL

###Block: Warping Surge abilities
Warping Surge Bond
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality
	DESC:After you have invoked a wild surge, all creatures within a %1 ft. radius are affected by a warping effect.  Your allies can choose to treat their manifester level as %2 higher for all powers manifested while in the warped area.  This does not supply any additional power points to augment the power, but does allow the manifester to spend more power points if he so chooses.  Your enemies treat their manifester level as %2 lower for all powers manifested while in the warped area.  If this would reduce the manifester level lower than that required to manifest the power, the effect fails and the enemy wastes the action used, but no power points are spent.  Spellcasters are affected in a similar fashion. All affected creatures, both allies who choose the manifester level boost and all enemies, suffer a 30%% risk of psychic enervation when manifesting powers or casting spells and suffer the same psychic enervation effects as you would.  This warping effect lasts for one round per point of wild surge that invoked the warping effect and does not stack with effects such as Overchannel or wild surge.|WarpingSurgeBondRadius|WarpingSurgeBondModifier
