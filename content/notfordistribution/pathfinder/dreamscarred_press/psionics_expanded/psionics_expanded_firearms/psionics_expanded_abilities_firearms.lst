Gun Kata
	KEY:Gun Kata ~ Grammaton
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality
	DESC:You learn how to channel your disrupt pattern into vicious melee attacks through your guns.  You can use your guns to perform melee attacks that deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus the base dirsupt pattern damage, with a critical multiplier of 20/x2.  The damage from enhanced disruption is not included in these attacks.  This use of disrupt pattern is not limited to once per round.  For each successful melee attack made with a handgun, if that gun is loaded, you can make a free ranged attack with that handgun against the creature struck.  These ranged touch attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.  The creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.
