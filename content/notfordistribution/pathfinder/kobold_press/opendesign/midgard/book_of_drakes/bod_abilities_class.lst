If the target of Smite Evil is an evil-aligned dragon the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to +%4. Regardless of the target, Smite Evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite evil is in effect, you gain a +%5 deflection bonus to your AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If you target a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.
