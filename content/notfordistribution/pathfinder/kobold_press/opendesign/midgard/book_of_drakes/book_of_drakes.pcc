DESC:There are no such things as "lesser" draconic kin, but lurking among the further branches of the dragon's family tree are many strange and wondrous creatures perhaps less powerful than their cousins but no less crafty or formidable. Shaped by their environment and powerful shapers of it, drakes interact with humans and other races a great deal, and from such relationships and rivalries are great adventures born!
