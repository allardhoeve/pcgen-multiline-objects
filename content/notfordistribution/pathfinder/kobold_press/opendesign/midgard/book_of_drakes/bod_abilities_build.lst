	BENEFIT:Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, you notice things you cannot see. The drake with line of effect to a creature or object within range of its blindsense ability usually need not make Perception checks to pinpoint that creature or object. Any opponent the drake cannot see still has total concealment against the drake, and it still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a drake with blindsense. A drake with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.

	BENEFIT:Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a drake with blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature. The creature ignores invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment, though the drake must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The drake usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Blindsight is continuous.

When choosing this ability, decide whether this damage is physical damage or acid damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but the drake does not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of damage required to get free equals 1/10 the drake's total hit points), or it can try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of the interior of a drake that swallows whole is %1. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the drake cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed.

Targets of a trample suffer damage equal to the drake's claw damage + 1-and-1/2 times its Str modifier. Targets of a trample can make an attack of opportunity at a -4 penalty or attempt to avoid the trampling creature and make a Reflex save (DC %1) to take half damage. A drake can only deal trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.|DrakeTrampleDC

A timber drake may take the form of a pine tree, while an alley drake could take the form of a cobblestone. The object must be the same or one size category larger or small as the drake. Choose the object when selecting this ability. Any carried or worn gear transforms with the drake. In this form the drake effectively is the object, though a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation aura. The drake can always hear but otherwise can use only senses the object might have; a statue might see but not touch, while a rag might touch but not see. The transformed drake gains a hardness score commensurate to the material of the object but retains its normal hit points.

	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.DrakeAlternateBreath
	DESC:This drake's breath weapon is a cone of jagged thorns.
	COST:5
	SOURCEPAGE:pg.57
	BENEFIT:This drake's breath weapon is a cone of jagged thorns. The attack deals 4d6 piercing damage. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 of the drake's racial Hit Dice + the drake's Con modifier) halves this damage. A creature suffering damage from this attack has a number of these thorns lodged in its body. It must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 of the drake's racial Hit Dice + the drake's Con modifier) or the thorns grow into the creature, reducing its mobility and hardening its flesh. One hour after the attack, the victim suffers 2d4 Dexterity damage. As the plants grow throughout the creature's body, its flesh takes on a bark-like appearance and texture, granting the creature a natural armor bonus equal to half the Dex damage dealt. Each hour afterwards, the creature must make a new Fortitude save or take the Dexterity damage again. A successful save halts the growth of the plant. The seed thorns can be removed with a successful DC 20 Heal check, with a +7 to the DC for every failed Fortitude save. All positive and negative effects fade 2d20 minutes after removing the thorns. Healing the Dexterity damage removes the natural armor bonus. A creature reduced to 0 Dexterity gains the paralyzed condition. This ability is usable every 1d4 rounds.
