--------------------------
Alchemist Class Archetypes
--------------------------

Draconic Mutagen complete and functional but I'm not happy with what I had to do to get it to work correctly as far as replacing "Immunity to Poison". The immunity is granted as part o the "Resistance to Poison" ability so in the PCGen implementaton of the Alchemist Draconic Mutagen partially replaces the basic ability. To do this I added a penalty to the vaiable AlchemistPoisonResistanceLVL equal to the number of levels above 8 that the Alchemist achieves. It does work though.

The stat bonuses and penalties are applied through temporary bonuses, one each for Draconic Mutagen (Wing) and Draconic Mutagen (Breath). These temporary bonuses are mutually exclusive in the PCGen Temporary Bonus interface.
