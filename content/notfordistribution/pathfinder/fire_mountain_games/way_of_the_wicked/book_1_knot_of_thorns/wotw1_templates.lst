Way of the Wicked Villain
	VISIBLE:YES
	BONUS:SKILLPOINTS|NUMBER|2
	DESC:This campaign lends itself more than most to a house rule that gives everyone two more skill points per level. The PCs will be on their own for much of the campaign and will have difficulty relying on others for skills. This house rule will make them more self-reliant. Besides, villains should more competent than the average man. Special: Add this template before you add the first class level, because the bonus skill points are not added retroactively.
