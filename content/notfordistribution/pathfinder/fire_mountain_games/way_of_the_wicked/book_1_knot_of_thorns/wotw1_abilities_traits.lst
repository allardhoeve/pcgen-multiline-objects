	DESC:You have forged documents issued either by the crown or by the Church of Mitra. Alas, that your forgery while competent was not entirely undetectable.

Benefit: You receive a +1 trait bonus to confirm critical hits
	SOURCEPAGE:p.92

	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Heresy],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]
	DESC:You have denied the supremacy of Mitra and been condemned for it. For this to be a crime, you were not content to keep your heresy to yourself. You tried to sway others.

To be successfully tried for High Treason you have done more than merely dislike the king, you did something tangible to undermine his rule. Alas, that you failed at your plot and are now headed to Branderscar Prison. Treason is the only crime that is still punished by the gruesome ritual of being drawn and quartered.

	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Murder],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]

	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Sedition],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]
	DESC:You have attempted to covertly stir up rebellion against your rightful sovereign. This differs from high treason in that you attempted to convince others to make war against Talingarde instead of taking direct action yourself. A subtle difference to be sure.

Benefit: You receive a +1 trait bonus to Bluff checks and Bluff becomes a class skill for you. Further if you ever take the Leadership feat, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your Leadership score.

	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Slave Trading],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]
	DESC:Slavery is legal in other parts of the world and it can be tempting to the most decadent of Talingarde's nobility to acquire a “souvenir” when traveling abroad or to purchase the object of their desire from a less reputable merchant.
