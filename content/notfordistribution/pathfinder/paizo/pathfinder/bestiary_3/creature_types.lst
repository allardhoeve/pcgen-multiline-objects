behemoth's regeneration-it regenerates even if

disintegrated or slain by a death effect

fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly,

it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no

further damage is dealt to its remains

spell can negate a behemoth's regeneration, but only

for 1d4 rounds per casting.

creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype

as it goes from plane to plane

if the creature had a good alignment, no matter what

the kami can observe the surrounding region with its

senses as if it were using its own body, as well as via

its ward, nor can it communicate or otherwise take any

action other than to emerge from its ward as a standard

action
	DESC:%nl; A kami must be adjacent to its ward to merge

with or emerge from it
	DESC:%nl; If its ward is a creature, plant, or

object, the kami can emerge mounted on the creature

provided the kami's body is at least one size category

smaller than the creature
	DESC:%nl; If its ward is a location, the

kami may emerge at any point within that location.

type of ward is listed in parentheses in the kami's stat

fear effect

with results similar to the tree shape spell
	DESC:%nl; Unlike that

spell, this ability only allows transformation into Small

plants of the same type of growth the leshy is related to.

In this form, the leshy appears as a particularly healthy

specimen of that particular plant
	DESC:%nl; A leshy can assume

plant form or revert to its true form as a swift action.

subject to a continual speak with plants spell, but only

with species they are related to.

a slain leshy heal 1d8 points of damage plus 1 point per

HD of the slain leshy, and plant life of the same type

as the leshy itself quickly infests the area
	DESC:%nl; If the terrain

can support this type of plant, the undergrowth is dense

enough to make the region into difficult terrain for 24

hours, after which the plant life diminishes to a normal

on movement and withers and dies within an hour.

and Sylvan.

functions as if it had spent 3 rounds concentrating and

thus gains the maximum amount of information possible.

The Will save DC to resist this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the

rakshasa's HD + the rakshasa's Charisma modifier.


	DESC:%nl; Enhanced Defenses (Ex) All rakshasas have DR that can

be penetrated by good and piercing weapons only

307

Appendices

A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted

here
	DESC:%nl; A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points,

a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single

Armor Class
	DESC:%nl; A swarm makes saving throws as a single

creature
	DESC:%nl; A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up

of non-f lying creatures) or a cube (if it is made up of f lying

creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its

component creatures
	DESC:%nl; In order to attack, it moves into an

opponent's space, which provokes an attack of opportunity.

A swarm can occupy the same space as a creature of any size,

since it crawls all over its prey
	DESC:%nl; A swarm can move through

squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without

impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of

opportunity if it does so
	DESC:%nl; A swarm can move through cracks

or holes large enough for its component creatures.

A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 non-f lying

creatures or 1,000 f lying creatures
	DESC:%nl; A swarm of Diminutive

creatures consists of 1,500 non-f lying creatures or 5,000

f lying creatures
	DESC:%nl; A swarm of Fine creatures consists of

10,000 creatures, whether they are f lying or not
	DESC:%nl; Swarms

of non-f lying creatures include many more creatures

than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their

normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed

tightly together and generally crawl over each other and

their prey when moving or attacking
	DESC:%nl; Larger swarms

are represented by multiples of single swarms
	DESC:%nl; The area

occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though

the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.

Swarm Traits
	DESC:A swarm has no clear front or back and no

discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or

f lanking
	DESC:%nl; A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half

damage from slashing and piercing weapons
	DESC:%nl; A swarm

composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune

to all weapon damage
	DESC:%nl; Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points

or less causes it to break up, though damage taken until

that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist

attack
	DESC:%nl; Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying

state by damage
	DESC:%nl; Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled,

or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets

a specific number of creatures (including single-target

spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of mindaffecting

effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects,

patterns, and phantasms) if the swarm has an Intelligence

score and a hive mind
	DESC:%nl; A swarm takes half again as much

damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area,

such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.

Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are

susceptible to high winds, such as those created by a gust

of wind spell
	DESC:%nl; For the purpose of determining the effects

of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the

same size as its constituent creatures
	DESC:%nl; A swarm rendered

unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes
