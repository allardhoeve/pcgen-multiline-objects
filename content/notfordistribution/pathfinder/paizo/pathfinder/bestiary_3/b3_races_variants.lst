VARIANT BANDERSNATCHES

Though no bandersnatch is ordinary, some are

rarer than others. The most famous

is the frumious bandersnatch,

brimming with rage so fierce it

burns. Variant bandersnatches

may combine two or more

of the abilities below.

Confounding Bandersnatch (+1 CR): Confounding

bandersnatches drip infectious madness from their

quills and Claws. Poison (Ex) Claws and quills-injury;

save Fort DC 29

frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes

effect

confused for 1 minute

cure 2 consecutive saves. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Frumious Bandersnatch (+2 CR): A frumious

bandersnatch seethes with barely repressed rage and anger.

If it misses with its Bite attack or falls below half of its hit

points, it succumbs to such uncontrollable fury that it bursts

into f lame. While engulfed in these f lames, a frumious

bandersnatch is affected as by a haste spell (this effect

cannot be dispelled) and causes an additional 2d6 points

of fire damage with each of its melee attacks and its quill

defense ability. The fury lasts for 5 rounds, after which the

bandersnatch cannot enter a fury again for another 5 rounds.

A frumious bandersnatch has fire resistance 30.

Lesser Bandersnatch (-4 CR): Smaller or younger

bandersnatches are still fearsome predators in their

own right. A lesser bandersnatch is Huge, with 4 fewer

Hit Dice than a typical bandersnatch. Reduce its physical

ability scores by 4 each and its Wisdom and Charisma by

2 each. A lesser bandersnatch lacks quick recovery and

deals 1d8+4 points of damage with its quill defense and

pain abilities. Lesser bandersnatches never have any

additional variant powers.

Magicbane Bandersnatch (+3 CR): These bandersnatches

radiate an antimagic aura in a 20-foot radius. Should

the aura be brought down, it returns automatically as a

free action on the bandersnatch's next turn. Magicbane

bandersnatches lack gaze and quick recovery.

Primal Bandersnatch (+2 CR): Primal bandersnatches

have kept their ties to the ancient world of the fey.

They have the extraplanar subtype,

SR equal to 11 plus their CR, 


	DR:10/

cold iron, and the advanced creature

simple template.



#BOG NIXIES
In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to

drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets

with song or by assuming the form of an animal or

humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous

waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering

swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog

nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes,

ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as

brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out.

A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced

creature template who has the following additional

powers. A bog nixie's


	CR:is +2 higher than a normal nixie's.

Captivating Song (Su): This works like the harpy ability

of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Change Shape (Su): This works as polymorph, and allows

the bog nixie to assume the form of any


	SIZE:S


	or Medium

aquatic animal or humanoid.

Minor Wish (Sp): Once per day, a bog

nixie can create a magical effect in

exchange for a gift or service from

a humanoid. The power of this

"wish" is no greater than what can

be done with a 3rd-level spell.
