SPECIAL ABILITIES

Dream Claws (Ex) A baku's claws are treated as cold iron and

magic for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

Dream Eating (Su) A baku can feed upon the dreams of any

single sleeping creature within 100 feet. Alternatively,

the baku can feed upon the dreams of a creature that

it manages to contact with its dream spell-like ability.

A creature can resist this effect with a DC 22 Will

save. When a baku feeds in this way, it can elect to

consume only nightmares or all dreams. If it only

consumes nightmares, the target creature is immune

to the effects of the nightmare spell, the dream

haunting ability of the night hag, and other similar attacks

for that period of sleep. If the baku instead feeds on all of

the creature's dreams, that creature is fatigued upon waking

and does not gain any benefits it would have received from

sleep, such as natural healing or the ability to regain spells

after resting. This is a mind-affecting sleep effect. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Mental Drain (Su) When a baku attacks with a claw, it can

choose, as a swift action, to deal 1d4 points of Intelligence

damage on that attack. A DC 22 Will save negates this

ability damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Bizarre creatures that feed on thoughts, bakus stay

hidden from humanoids and feed on their creativity

and dreams as well as their fears and nightmares. Bakus

rarely encounter others of their kind, living largely

solitary lives. Some sages speculate the creatures are not

born, but rather spontaneously manifest as if spun from

dreams, nightmares, and creative thoughts. Bakus are

about 5 feet long and weigh 100 pounds.

Bakus dislike feeding on thoughts concerning

themselves, and tend to cease when their target begins

thinking of the baku. For this reason, bakus keep hidden

in settlements, f loating in the evening air above bedrooms

and boarding houses, siphoning sustenance from the

dreaming populace. Bakus themselves do not sleep.

Given their connection to dreams and nightmares,

bakus are mortal enemies of night hags. Though usually

calm and gentle creatures, bakus that encounter night

hags dedicate themselves to hunting them down and

ridding the world of their dark inf luence. A baku uses its

ethereal jaunt spell-like ability to fight night hags as they

inf lict nightmares on their victims.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Bounding Charge (Ex) A bandersnatch can move through

difficult terrain when it charges.

Brutal Tail (Ex) The quills and barbs on a bandersnatch's

tail cause triple damage on a critical hit from its tail slap.

A bandersnatch adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on

attack rolls when using its tail slap.

Gaze (Su) Confused, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 29 negates. A

bandersnatch can direct its gaze attack against a single foe

as a swift action. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Lash Out (Ex) As a swift action, a bandersnatch can make a

single attack with a bite, claw, or tail slap. A bandersnatch

cannot lash out on the same round it charges.

Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a

bandersnatch's tail slap attack, quills, or quill defense, that

creature must make a DC 28 Reflex save or a quill lodges in

its flesh, causing the creature to become sickened until the

quill is removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 20 Heal

check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the

check exceeds the DC, one additional quill can be removed.

On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process

deals 1d10+6 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is

Dexterity-based.

Planar Acclimation (Ex) A bandersnatch is always considered

to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds

itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.

Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a bandersnatch

with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural

weapon takes 1d10 points of piercing damage from the

bandersnatch's quills and suffers from the bandersnatch's

pain attack.

Quick Recovery (Su) A debilitated bandersnatch recovers with

frightening speed. If a bandersnatch starts its turn affected

by any or all of the following conditions, these conditions

end at the end of its turn: confused, dazed, dazzled,

exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and stunned.

Furthermore, a bandersnatch affected by ability damage,

ability drain, or a mind-affecting effect that allows a save

receives a single additional save against the effect of its

choice at the original DC at the end of its turn in order to

shake off the effect.

Quills (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a bandersnatch can loose a

volley of four quills as a standard action (make an attack roll

for each spike). This attack has a range of 300 feet with no

range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each

other. Launched quills regrow in a single round, during

which the bandersnatch's defensive abilities are unaffected.

Relentless Tracker (Ex) A bandersnatch can move at up to

double its speed and still track without penalty. It gains a

+10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track

creatures it has wounded.

Bandersnatches are consummate hunters, and only the

deadliest predators or the most cunning intelligent prey

offer them sport. Once a bandersnatch has marked a

creature for death, it runs it to ground without fear, rest,

or remorse.

Bandersnatches rely on speed, shock, and terror to bring

down prey. They pace their quarry from a distance, hidden

among the trees, then break from cover, savage their

target, and dart away again. They drag smaller creatures

away to dispatch at leisure, while engaging larger ones

in skirmishes until they gradually wear their prey down.

An outmatched bandersnatch withdraws at full speed,

32

Illustration by Dave Allsop

Bandersnatch

stopping only to pick off pursuers that distance themselves

from their allies. Once its wounds heal, the bandersnatch

returns to the scene of its defeat, picks up the trail of its

assailants, and eliminates them one by one.

In appearance, a bandersnatch resembles a tawny,

six-legged great cat, but with wickedly barbed quills

running the length of its body and down to the tip of its

long, f lexible tail. Its quills serve to deter attackers, but

also act as a formidable weapon. With a single f lick of

its muscular tail, a bandersnatch can f ling as many as a

half-dozen quills at distant foes with surprising accuracy. A

bandersnatch captivates any prey that meets the gaze of

its saucerlike, luminous eyes. A bandersnatch measures 40

feet in length plus another 10 feet of tail and weighs 12,000

pounds. Despite their bulk, bandersnatches move with

speed, grace, and even considerable stealth when required.

Bandersnatches were once native to the primal world of

the fey, where they preyed on the greatest hunters of that

ancient realm. As with other legendary creatures from this

realm, such as the jabberwock, bandersnatches belong to a

group of creatures known collectively as the "Tane." Whether

the fey were careless in guarding their portals or released

the first bandersnatches into Material Plane deliberately

cannot be said with certainty. Rare in the extreme on the

Material Plane, bandersnatches lair within forgotten forests

where ancient beasts walk the world.

Bandersnatches mate only rarely. A female becomes fertile

perhaps once or twice per century, leaving the male soon

after mating and giving birth to only one or two kittens per

litter. The mother brings meat to her ravenous young, which

mature into lesser bandersnatches (see below) within a year.

Bandersnatches live for a thousand years or longer.

VARIANT BANDERSNATCHES

Though no bandersnatch is ordinary, some are

rarer than others. The most famous

is the frumious bandersnatch,

brimming with rage so fierce it

burns. Variant bandersnatches

may combine two or more

of the abilities below.

Confounding Bandersnatch (+1 CR): Confounding

bandersnatches drip infectious madness from their

quills and claws. Poison (Ex) Claws and quills-injury;

save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect

confused for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Frumious Bandersnatch (+2 CR): A frumious

bandersnatch seethes with barely repressed rage and anger.

If it misses with its bite attack or falls below half of its hit

points, it succumbs to such uncontrollable fury that it bursts

into f lame. While engulfed in these f lames, a frumious

bandersnatch is affected as by a haste spell (this effect

cannot be dispelled) and causes an additional 2d6 points

of fire damage with each of its melee attacks and its quill

defense ability. The fury lasts for 5 rounds, after which the

bandersnatch cannot enter a fury again for another 5 rounds.

A frumious bandersnatch has fire resistance 30.

Lesser Bandersnatch (-4 CR): Smaller or younger

bandersnatches are still fearsome predators in their

own right. A lesser bandersnatch is Huge, with 4 fewer

Hit Dice than a typical bandersnatch. Reduce its physical

ability scores by 4 each and its Wisdom and Charisma by

2 each. A lesser bandersnatch lacks quick recovery and

deals 1d8+4 points of damage with its quill defense and

pain abilities. Lesser bandersnatches never have any

additional variant powers.

Magicbane Bandersnatch (+3 CR): These bandersnatches

radiate an antimagic aura in a 20-foot radius. Should

the aura be brought down, it returns automatically as a

free action on the bandersnatch's next turn. Magicbane

bandersnatches lack gaze and quick recovery.

Primal Bandersnatch (+2 CR): Primal bandersnatches

have kept their ties to the ancient world of the fey.

They have the extraplanar subtype,

SR equal to 11 plus their CR, DR 10/

cold iron, and the advanced creature

simple template.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Devouring grapple (Ex) The mouth at the center of a

baregara's chest automatically deals 2d8+4 points

of damage per round to any creature the baregara

successfully grapples.

Monstrous Challenge (Su) As a standard action,

a baregara can make an Intimidate check to

demoralize an opponent. If this check is successful,

the baregara surges with power and gains a +4

enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution for 10

minutes. This ability is usable three times per day.

One-Armed Hold (Ex) A baregara's huge arms allow it to initiate

and maintain a grapple without the standard -4 penalty for

not having both hands free.

Although natives of the Abyss that often serve as minions

for powerful demons or demon lords, baregaras are not

in fact demons themselves. Some scholars classify them

as "proto-demons"-monsters like bebiliths or xacabras

that could perhaps someday complete their supernatural

evolution into full demonic glory, but that have not quite

yet reached that end. Of course, to the baregara's victims,

these debates are incidental.

In the Abyss, baregaras form small troops just like

the apes of the Material Plane. These troops are led by

the strongest fighter or an individual anointed by a

powerful demon the baregara troop serves. Rivalries

between troops are part of a complex hierarchy that is

all but incomprehensible to non-baregaras, but planar

scholars have observed that all baregaras take trophies

from notable kills, and that these grisly mementos play

some role in establishing the convoluted social standing

of the troop leaders and their followers.

Even when knuckle-walking on their enormous hands,

baregaras stand over 12 feet high when measured to the top

of their horns, and their dense bodies can weigh

up to 1,500 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Devour Soul (Su) A baykok can take a standard action to

devour the soul of an adjacent dead or dying creature. A

dying creature can resist this attack with a DC 19 Fortitude

save. If it fails, the target is instantly slain. If the creature

is already dead, it does not make a saving throw, although

the body cannot be more than 1 hour dead. A creature

subjected to this attack cannot be brought back to life via

raise dead (resurrection and more powerful effects work

normally). When a baykok devours a soul in this way, it

heals 5d6+10 points of damage and becomes hasted for 4

rounds (as if affected by haste). This is a death effect. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Dread Howl (Su) Once per day, a baykok can unleash a bloodcurdling

howl. Any living creature within a 30-foot-radius

burst becomes paralyzed with fear for 1 round unless it

resists with a DC 19 Will save. Any creature that makes this

saving throw is instead shaken for 1 round. This is a fear

effect. The DC is Charisma-based.

Infused Arrows (Su) A baykok creates

arrows of bone as it fires its bow-it need

not carry arrows as ammunition. These bone

arrows do normal damage for arrows fired from

the bow, but gain a +1 enhancement bonus on

attack and damage rolls. In addition, each arrow

deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy on

a hit. Further, the first creature struck in a round by a

baykok's arrow must make a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid

being paralyzed for 1d3 rounds. A baykok can fire normal

arrows from its bow if it wishes-such arrows, however, do

not gain the special negative energy damage or paralysis

effects. The DC is Charisma-based.

When hunters become utterly obsessed with the chase and

indulge excessively in the savagery of the kill, their souls

become progressively tainted. When such remorseless

hunters perish before they can capture and kill their

quarry, they sometimes rise from death as baykoks-

f lying undead horrors that kill purely for the ecstasy that

only murder can bring them.

Unlike many undead who feed on and hate all living

things, a baykok seeks always to prove its mastery of the

hunt. Though thoroughly wicked, baykoks often ignore

all but the most powerful-looking foe in a group, only

picking off lesser creatures if they dare to get between

the baykok and its true prey. When it finally lays low its

quarry, the baykok swoops down on the victim to devour

the creature's soul in an attempt to make sure the creature

never returns to seek revenge.

Behemoth

Immense, ageless, and very nearly invincible, behemoths

deliver divine retribution to the mortal realms. Shaped

from the primal energies of creation and infused with

elemental might, behemoths resemble living creatures,

but lack the frailties of f lesh. Marginally more intelligent

than the smartest animal, behemoths can understand

Aklo but cannot speak. Nothing less than a god or the most

potent of legendary artifacts can command a behemoth,

and even the gods feel some trepidation at unleashing

one, lest the behemoth cast off its reins and turn its wrath

against its maker.

For nearly as long as mortals have worshiped the gods,

mortals have known hubris and the gods' righteous

anger. When a mortal's offense grows too great for divine

patience to suffer, the gods lash out through plagues

and f loods, and through their terrible servants. Of these

vengeful minions, the behemoths are among the most

feared. A god or coalition of gods creates a behemoth

from the wellsprings of primal chaos, binds it into a

semblance of f lesh, and fills its mind with righteousness

and the thirst to destroy all in its path. The beast is

then turned loose upon its victims-those deemed most

deserving of bearing the brunt of the wrath of the gods.

Some deities stay close at hand as their beasts savage the

lands, the better to turn the creatures aside once their

divine anger is appeased, while others turn their backs

on mortal plights, leaving behemoths to expend their

anger until naught but lifeless cinders remain. Entire

worlds have been destroyed by these living retributions.

Such shattered lands might have nothing left alive save

for the conquering behemoths themselves, immortal,

living monuments to murdered worlds.

While behemoths are created by the gods, their

forms and countenances are the result of which of three

domains they have been created to rule-air, earth, or

sea. Each of these realms is in turn associated with one

of three common types of behemoths-if the application

of a word like "common" is even appropriate for such an

uncommon creature.

Behemoths cast upon a world's landmasses are known

as thunder behemoths. These are the least of their kind,

yet they are formidable, nigh unstoppable engines of

armageddon nevertheless. They are the behemoths of

choice when it comes to destroying a single nation or

empire, for while devastating, they are bound to the land

itself, and their advances across a globe are thus more

limited than those of the two greater behemoths.

When several nations or regions evoke the gods' wrath,

a thalassic behemoth is sent into that world's oceans to

wreak havoc. By disrupting oceanic trade, destroying

port cities, and rendering well-populated shores all but

uninhabitable, thalassic behemoths excel at destroying

civilizations where they are most vulnerable. A vengeful

god may inf lict several thunder behemoths upon a realm

that has wronged it, placing a thalassic behemoth in the

ocean to finalize the devastation.

The most devastating of the three common behemoths

is the tempest behemoth, a tremendous birdlike monster

capable of devastating numerous lands in a short amount

of time. Because it rules the skies above those lands the

gods wish to smite, the tempest behemoth has greater

mobility than its other kin. When the gods are truly

vexed, they might set upon a world numerous behemoths,

but the conditions that might call for the deployment of

more than a solitary tempest behemoth boggle the mind

nearly as much as the sheer size of any of these monsters

does-few worlds are capable of the level of blasphemy

and hubris that would necessitate multiple tempest

behemoths as divine punishment.

Other behemoths exist, such as sirocco behemoths that

f lay with air and fire, behemoths of the lightless depths

of the oceans, and dread holocaust behemoths forged of

lightning and fire. Some deities take particular delight in

spawning truly unique and powerful behemoths-many

scholars place the legendary tarrasque in this category,

even though its powers are quite different than those

shared by most other behemoths. Regardless of their

nature, each behemoth suffers a single f law by which it

might be slain, a chink in its immortality. Some attribute

this weakness, however small, to the imperfect process

of binding chaos to order, others to divine caution, lest a

behemoth one day prove a match for the gods themselves.

A behemoth's creation is not always the act of a cruel

god seeking to inf lict devastation on an innocent world-

often, these monsters are created by good or neutral deities

to serve as instruments of justice. Perhaps ironically, gods

of a more lawful or civilized bent are the most apt to call

up a behemoth, as gods of the natural world either aren't

inclined to punish mortals at all, or would instead make

use of natural disasters like earthquakes and storms to

teach lessons to their wayward followers. While a single

behemoth usually suffices, multiple creatures of this

kind are sometimes visited upon a world. While it may be

small solace, behemoths are incapable of procreation-

regardless of the total number of behemoths active on

a world at any one time, that number does not increase

without the direct, vengeful intervention of a deity.

Even societies that refrain from insulting the gods are

not immune to the behemoth's wrath, for the gods rarely

remove these beasts when their work is done. An ancient

civilization destroyed by a behemoth may still harbor

in its ruined heart a slumbering monster, waiting only

for the right moment or a tragic accident to waken and

ravage once again.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Gale (Su) A tempest behemoth can generate winds of up to

hurricane force as a free action, blowing in as many as three

different directions at once. The winds blow either away

from or directly toward the behemoth in a 30-foot-wide

path that extends for 1,000 feet.

Scales (Ex) A tempest behemoth can hurl up to six scales from

its wings (range increment 100 feet) as a standard action.

Thunderbolt (Su) As a

swift action once

every 1d4 rounds, a

behemoth can shoot a

bolt of lightning that deals 15d6 points of electricity

damage and 15d6 points of sonic damage, and that causes

permanent deafness in a 200-foot line (DC 34 Reflex save

halves damage and negates deafness). The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Riding the winds on a triple set of wings, tempest behemoths

f ly above all, death riding in their shadows. In battle, they

snatch up foes only to cast them away from great heights,

smash enemies with their wings, or hurl razor-edged scales

at distant targets. A tempest behemoth's divine heritage

wards its body, mind, and soul against harm. Only the most

powerful magic or attack can pierce its defenses. Serene in

their immortality, tempest behemoths fear no other being.

As living forces of divine retribution, tempest behemoths

are sent forth into the world to raze far-f lung cities,

ravage towns with mighty storms, level remote mountain

temples, and tear apart siege fortresses impregnable from

the ground.

The advent of a tempest behemoth is generally

presaged by foul weather and terrific storms that drive

f locks of birds before their headwinds. The day before the

behemoth arrives, the storms suddenly abate-ironically

encouraging victims to emerge into the open just as the

behemoth strikes.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Water Jet (Su) A thalassic behemoth can blast water from its

blowhole with surprising force and accuracy. This water jet

has a range of 240 feet with no range penalties. A target hit

by the water jet is subject to the behemoth's push ability

and must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude save or be stunned

for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Sent by the gods to punish those who dwell near the sea,

thalassic behemoths scourge ships and other vessels from

the waters before turning their attention toward structures

and survivors on land. Despite their massive bulk, thalassic

behemoths swim incredibly fast and can easily outpace all

but the f leetest of ships. On land, they can be more readily

escaped, at least by those willing and able to leave homes and

belongings behind. Though capable of surviving indefinitely

on land and employing a clumsy, seal-like locomotion,

thalassic behemoths soon weary of gravity's never-ending

drag. They rarely venture more than a mile or two from shore

before returning to the comforting buoyancy of the seas.

Thalassic behemoths resemble immense sperm whales

in the water, but they can quickly haul themselves ashore

using their mighty forelimbs. Tail and limb alike shatter

wood and stone with but a single blow, while their jaws

gape wide enough to swallow smaller boats whole.

The coming of a thalassic behemoth is typically

foreshadowed by a dramatic increase in missing ships,

strange tides, and the uncanny sight of sea life purposefully

beaching upon shores. Thalassic behemoths generally

spend much of their time lurking a few hundred

feet below the surface-but legends hold that

even greater behemoths, the dread

leviathans, dwell in the deepest

oceanic reaches.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Mighty Roar (Su) Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a

thunder behemoth can issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot

cone that duplicates the effect of an empowered greater

shout (Fortitude DC 30 for half damage). This is a sonic

effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Rock Spitting (Ex) A thunder behemoth can spit rocks from

the essentially inexhaustible store in its gizzard. It can

spit up to four rocks as a standard action, with a range

increment of 60 feet. A creature that is critically hit by one

of these rocks must make a DC 38 Fortitude save to resist

being stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.

Swallow Whole (Ex) A thunder behemoth has five stomachs

and can shunt a swallowed victim into any one of them

(usually choosing an empty stomach).

Thunder behemoths walk the land as little more than

roving appetites, driven by an all-consuming hunger

to devour every animal, plant, and even building in

sight. They indiscriminately gorge their five seemingly

bottomless stomachs on forests and jungles, collapse mine

and mountain alike in search of ore, and raze settlements

and strongholds for the cowering morsels within.

Thunder behemoths are sent out by the gods to destroy

wicked cities, raze great temples or monuments that

offend divine eyes, and otherwise act as instruments

of divine wrath either on the surface of a world or just

below it. The days before a thunder behemoth arrives are

fraught with minor but unnerving earthquakes, mass

exoduses of burrowing animals to the surface, and an

unexplained increase in fallen trees and sinkholes.

spirit is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it returns to the

body immediately. A berbalang in spirit form can end the

effect at any time as a standard action, at which point the

spirit immediately returns to the body. When a berbalang's

spirit form returns to the body, add both the spirit body's hit

points and the physical body's hit points back together to

determine the creature's current hit point total.

Berbalangs prefer to make their homes within a day's

travel of humanoid settlements. These lairs are well

hidden and sometimes protected by other undead

creatures. Some berbalangs set themselves up as secluded

shamans or wise old crones, using alter self to appear

human. Ultimately cowardly, berbalangs rarely attack a

settlement directly, preferring to pluck its meals from those

who stray too far from civilization. A berbalang stands as

tall as a human and rarely weighs more than 100 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Blood Drain (Su) As a

standard action, a bhuta

can suck blood from an

adjacent opponent that is

taking bleed damage.

The target takes 1d6

points of Constitution

damage (Fort DC 23 for

half). The bhuta heals 5 hit

points when it drains blood.

Cold Iron Weakness (Su) A cold iron weapon is considered to

be magical when used against a bhuta. A magic cold iron

weapon always functions as a ghost touch weapon when

used against a bhuta.

A bhuta is a ghostlike undead creature born of horrible

death or murder in a natural setting. It is a manifestation

of rage at the injustice of a death that interrupted

important business or unsated desires. Doomed to haunt

the wilderness within several miles of the site of its demise,

a bhuta turns to the local fauna as tools for its vengeance.

A bhuta can appear in a variety of animalistic forms

by using its veil ability, but its natural appearance is that

of a bestial humanoid phantom that f loats a foot above

the ground as it moves. While bhutas are incorporeal, the

touch of their claws creates horrific, bleeding wounds.

A bhuta's feet point backward. To disguise its nature, a

bhuta can appear solid, manifesting in long robes that

help disguise the fact that it f loats and has strange feet.

By means of its magic jar spell-like ability, a bhuta can

also possess living animals to use as its minions; an

animal possessed by a bhuta casts no shadow, and

therefore prefers to lurk in heavily canopied or

thicketed areas, waiting for the right time to

strike out and attack intruders.

Animals find themselves attracted to bhutas,

which use their spell-like abilities to manipulate

such victims toward evil and deceptive ends.

Bhutas generally avoid inf luencing animal

companions or domesticated animals, for

changes in behavior among such creatures

can easily arouse suspicion and reveal a

bhuta's presence and inf luence.

A bhuta might have tasks it wishes to

complete from its previous existence

as a living creature, or it might

work against those who slew its

living form. This link to its past

life is vague and compulsive

rather than clear, unlike that

of a ghost.

Bhutas who have no specific

target for retribution still

seek to trouble those living in or near

their domains, coaxing passersby into

accepting them as traveling companions

and using their inf luence over animals

as a testament to their benevolence.

When invited to join a group, a bhuta

can journey outside its normal territory.

However, a bhuta's hunger for living

blood usually drives it to attack its

companions before it wanders far.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Deepest Fear (Su) A bogeyman is cloaked in

a 30-foot aura of fear. This aura manifests

as a shifting haze of images that reflect the

viewer's deepest fears. The first time it

ends its turn within the aura, a creature must make a DC 25

Will save or become shaken for as long as it stays within the

aura. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot

be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a

fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.

Striking Fear (Su) If a bogeyman confirms a critical hit or a sneak

attack with one of its claws on a target currently suffering a

fear effect, that effect automatically becomes one step more

severe (shaken creatures become frightened, frightened

creatures become panicked, and panicked creatures cower

in fear). A DC 25 Will save negates this increase. In addition,

a critical hit from the bogeyman's claw forces any target that

has successfully saved against the creature's fear aura to make

another Will save against its effects, even if 24 hours have not

yet passed. This is a fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.

Terrible Rejuvenation (Su) A bogeyman gains fast healing 5 while

any creature within its deepest fear aura is suffering from a

fear effect, including any fear effect created by the aura itself.

Many believe that the most cruel and mischievous

fey become bogeymen as a punishment or a

reward for their actions. Others

see bogeymen as supernatural

manifestations of society's

willingness to do itself harm.

Bogeymen use their powers to

haunt houses or secluded natural

places where they can hunt prey

unobserved. They relish using

their ghost sound ability to hint at

their presence long before they

fully reveal themselves. It is not

uncommon for a bogeyman to

hide under a bed, or in a closet

left slightly ajar, for days or even

weeks, all the while feeding on

its victims' growing realization

that they are not alone.

The most evil bogeymen

are those who abandon

the tactic of feeding on

one person's fears at a

time and take up roles of

mass murderers or serial

killers, or other pursuits

designed to drive fear into

the hearts of an entire city of

victims. True to their name, all

bogeymen are male. Sometimes,

children whom they steal away to secret

lairs emerge years later, transformed

into new bogeymen, and return home to

continue their supernatural father's work.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Neural Pulse (Su) Creatures hit by a brain ooze's tentacle must

succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of

Intelligence damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds. Each

time a brain ooze causes Intelligence damage, it gains 5

temporary hit points. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Prescience (Su) Limited precognitive abilities grant a brain ooze

a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks, on Reflex saves, and to

its Armor Class. Brain oozes are never surprised or flat-footed.

Psychic Noise (Su) The discordant psychic noise emitted by

a brain ooze dazes nearby creatures for 1d4 rounds. When

a creature begins its turn within the aura, it must succeed

at a DC 19 Will save to negate this

effect. Whether or not the save is

successful, that creature cannot

be affected again by the same

brain ooze's psychic noise for

24 hours. An affected creature

may attempt a new save to shake off

the effect at the end of each of

its turns. This is a mindaffecting

effect. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

A brain ooze (sometimes

known as a "killer brain")

resembles almost precisely

the raw brain of a human,

save for the eldritch energy

surrounding it and the twin

tentacles extending from its

sides. The creature's thought patterns are

unusually powerful, and cause painful

mental feedback in the minds

of other conscious beings.

Other intelligent beings

are nothing more than cattle

and playthings to brain oozes-victims to be tormented,

thought patterns to be consumed. Brain oozes prefer to

manipulate their prey from the shadows. Rather than

assaulting openly, they provoke fights and conf lict

within groups, or lure one or two victims away for the kill.

Brain oozes derive particular satisfaction from forcing

an individual to commit terrible acts, then wiping away

all knowledge of the crimes from the victim's memory.

They torment such hapless puppets again and again,

forcing them to commit ever greater atrocities. Once

weary of their sport they return the modified memories

with dispel magic, and feast upon the delicious misery of

the victim's final despair.

Brain oozes feed through their tentacles by extracting

the thoughts of living creatures. Animals and less

intelligent creatures provide little nourishment, but they

prize fey, outsiders, and spellcasters as delicacies. After

several feedings, a brain ooze divides into two nearly

identical brains, each retaining only a portion of the

knowledge and experiences of the parent.

The similarities between intellect devourers and

brain oozes have not gone unnoticed, but the two species

appear to have little in common beyond appearance.

Some theorize that brain oozes are actually the result of

an ancient race's failed attempt to achieve immortality

by preserving their minds via alien technology or magic.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Empath (Su) Carbuncles possess a crude form of telepathy,

allowing them to transmit mild impressions and

remembered sensations to other creatures. This form of

telepathy cannot convey language or hinder a target

in any way (such as by transmitting pain). Thus, a

carbuncle can relate a feeling of fear or the faint

smell of leaves, but cannot directly warn an ally of

a monster or tell of a treasure under a dirt mound.

Fatal Faker (Su) As a standard action three times

per day, a carbuncle can teleport as per the spell

dimension door, but only within a range of 30

feet. Upon teleporting, the carbuncle leaves

behind a perfect replica of itself amid a colored flash

and the sound of a reptilian choke. This replica duplicates

the carbuncle in all ways, though it is obviously dead and the

colorless stone in its head is reduced to worthless dust.

Specious Suggestion (Su) As a standard action three times per

day, a carbuncle can concentrate intently on one creature

within its line of sight and attempt to impose its will

upon the target. A DC 11 Will save is enough to resist this

compulsion. If the target fails to resist, roll 1d6. On a result of

1-2, the target gains a flash of insight and a +2 insight bonus

to its Armor Class for 1 minute. On a result of 3-4, the victim

is affected as if by suggestion for 1 minute, and must follow

a single (usually embarrassing, always harmless) suggestion

from the carbuncle. On a result of 5-6, the victim's thoughts

are garbled with those of the carbuncle, imposing a -2

penalty to the victim's Will saving throws for 1 minute. This is

a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Vulnerability to Suggestion (Ex) Any mind-affecting spell can

affect a carbuncle regardless of creature type limitations.

A spell like charm person, for example, which typically only

affects humanoid creatures, can also affect carbuncles.

Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more

inauspicious brow than that of the lowly carbuncle. Even

the creature's name summons ideas that range from the

grandiose to the grotesque. Carbuncles appear to be little

more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart, however,

is their strange magical abilities and the fist-sized gemstone

horn jutting from above their bulging eyes. Although tales

differ regarding the type and value of the stone, many claim

it is a ruby or garnet. In truth, however, a carbuncle's gem

is merely a highly ref lective growth, not unlike a fingernail.

Carbuncles exhibit a peculiar attraction to magic-users,

especially sorcerers with the fey bloodline and any who

pack supplies of fresh fruit. Many enchanters laud the

extraordinary mind-control powers of these intense creatures

and extol the aid they can offer mages of their field-though

others consider such tales something of an academic in-joke.

A neutral spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can

gain a carbuncle as a familiar at 5th level.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Brittle (Ex) Bludgeoning and sonic attacks can inflict critical

hits on a carnivorous crystal. A successful critical hit from

such attacks causes the carnivorous crystal to split, even if

the attack causes no damage. The crystal remains immune

to precision-based damage, such as damage from

sneak attacks.

Crystallize (Ex) A creature entrapped by a

carnivorous crystal's attack must succeed at a

DC 22 Fortitude save each round or become

helpless. If a helpless creature fails this save,

it becomes petrified as its body crystallizes. In

1d4 hours, the petrified victim shatters and a new

carnivorous crystal emerges from the remains.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Razor Sharp (Ex) A carnivorous crystal's slam attack

deals devastating piercing and slashing damage,

and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.

Subsonic Hum (Su) An active carnivorous crystal

gives off supernatural sonic vibrations. Any

living creature starting its turn within

this aura must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be

stunned for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves

cannot be affected by the same carnivorous crystal's

subsonic hum for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting

effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Natives of the endless caverns of the Plane of Earth,

carnivorous crystals normally lead quiet existences,

subsisting on minerals leeched from the surrounding

rock. Living creatures, however, provide a veritable feast,

as devouring the minerals in their bones and blood

allows a crystal to reproduce in mere hours instead of

years. Though lacking in anything that could be called

intelligence, carnivorous crystals sense the living, and

hunger for the sustenance trapped within their bodies.

On the Plane of Earth and in the deepest caverns of

the Material Plane, ancient carnivorous crystals grow

without bounds, reaching incredible sizes.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A caryatid column

is immune to any spell or spell-like ability

that allows spell resistance. In addition,

certain spells and effects function differently

against the creature, as noted below.

. A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points

of damage per caster level to a caryatid

column, with no saving throw.

. Transmute mud to rock immediately heals

any and all damage currently suffered by a

caryatid column.

. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change

the column's structure but negates its damage

reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round.

Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character

strikes a caryatid column with a weapon

(magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes

3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's

hardness normally. Weapons that take

any amount of damage in excess of their

hardness gain the broken quality.

Statue (Ex) A caryatid column can

stand perfectly still, emulating a

statue (usually one that is holding

up the ceiling, like a carved

column). An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception

check to notice the caryatid column is alive. If a caryatid

column initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus

on its initiative check.

Caryatid columns are the lesser cousins of true golems,

constructs created by spellcasters to guard objects or areas.

Unlike true golems, caryatid columns cannot be made

into shield guardians, but they are often used in greater

numbers because of their relatively inexpensive creation

cost. Each caryatid column is programmed to guard an

object or area when created, and once set, this command

cannot be changed. Caryatid columns are often given

specific parameters concerning whom to ignore and whom

to attack, but since they have no special form of

detection, such restrictions can be overcome

with disguises if the parameters are known.

A caryatid column stands 7 feet tall and

weighs 1,500 pounds. Caryatid columns are always

equipped with a masterwork weapon that appears to

be made out of stone as long as the construct remains

in statue form. The weapon can be recovered after

a caryatid column has been defeated. Arming

a caryatid column with magical weapons is

expensive but feasible-even the most powerful

of magic weapons appear as nothing more than

stone when held by a caryatid column. Since a

weapon held in this manner does not radiate

magic, many use this trait as a method to

hide potent or powerful weapons from both

casual observation and study via detect magic.

True seeing reveals such disguised weapons for

what they really are. Often, only particularly

powerful caryatid columns (typically those with

advanced Hit Dice, but rarely those made much

larger than


	SIZE:M


	size) are entrusted with the

care and protection of such weapons. Of course,

the constructs themselves make full use of any

magic weapons they are given to guard.

CONSTRUCTION

A caryatid column's body is carved from a single

2,000-pound block of stone, such as granite or

marble. The stone must be of exceptional quality,

and costs 2,000 gp.

1 chief of 6th level plus 6-12 cheetahs or leopards)

Treasure NPC gear (studded leather armor, longbow with 20

arrows, longsword, other treasure)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Cat's Luck (Ex) Once per day when a catfolk makes a

Reflex saving throw, it can roll the saving throw twice

and take the better result. It must decide to use this

ability before the saving throw is attempted.

Sprinter (Ex) A catfolk gains a 10-foot racial bonus

to its speed when using the charge, run, or

withdraw actions.

Most catfolk are tribal hunter-gatherers

who dwell in harmony with nature, though some

tribes have acclimated well to urban environments. As

a culture, catfolk are loyal, generous, and amiable. They

like belonging to and being at harmony with a group

whose members work together to accomplish their needs

and wants. Tribal catfolk prefer for the most capable

societal members to lead, so every tribe has a council

of elevated subchiefs. A tribe's chief is usually the most

competent (and magically talented) member of that tribe.

Personal growth is part of catfolk culture, as is

expression as a means of personal exploration. Catfolk

have few taboos, and often exhibit harmless but strange

eccentricities. Individuals cultivate a wide range of

pursuits and self-expression, taking risks others might

label unwise. Most individual catfolk like to be the center

of attention, but not at the cost of group cohesion.

CATFOLK CHARACTERS

Catfolk have no racial Hit Dice, gaining their capabilities

from class levels. All catfolk have the following racial traits.

+2 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Catfolk are

agile and amiable, but they are known for their lack of

common sense and self-control.

Low-Light Vision: In dim light, catfolk can see twice

as far as humans.

Cat's Luck: See above.

Sprinter: See above.

Natural Hunter: Catfolk receive a +2 racial bonus on

Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks.

Languages: Catfolk speak Catfolk

and Common. A catfolk who

has a high Intelligence score

can choose from the following

bonus languages: Elven, Gnoll,

Gnome, Goblin,

Half ling, Orc,

and Sylvan.

AKVAN PRINCES

As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies,

many gravitate toward one of the races of geniekind,

targeting members of that race with particular passion.

Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in

slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who

blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them

into akvan princes.

Each akvan prince dedicates itself to

extinguishing a particular type of genie and

gains special abilities with which to slaughter

genies of that type. An

akvan prince gains an

additional 4-8 Hit Dice,

a +4 bonus to three

ability scores, and has a


	CR:of 22- 24.

The akvan prince also gains one of the

following sets of abilities, depending

on what type of genies it hunts.

Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting

akvan prince shatters the strongest

stone. It gains the stone glide ability,

tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow

speed of 100 feet, and its natural

attacks are treated as adamantine

for the purposes of overcoming

damage reduction. It also gains

the following spell-like abilities:

3/day-quickened stone shape,

transmute mud to rock,

transmute rock to mud, wish.

Dying Ember: An efreethating

akvan prince holds

dominion over flame.

It gains resist fire 30, an

efreeti's heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when

grappling or grappled), and the following spell-like

abilities: at will-quickened quench, scorching ray,

wall of fire; 3/day-wish.

Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains

power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the

whirlwind ability, its f ly speed increases to 120 feet (perfect

maneuverability), and it gains the following spell-like

abilities: at will-invisibility; 3/day-gaseous form, wish.

Thirsty Sea: A marid-slaying akvan prince controls and

poisons water. It gains a swim speed of 100 feet, a marid's

water's fury special attack (8d6 points of damage, blinds

and stuns for 1d6 rounds), and the following spell-like

abilities: constant-water breathing, water walk; at will-

quickened control water; 3/day-horrid wilting, wish.

Unbalanced Soul: A jann-killing akvan prince spreads

failure and defeat. It gains resist acid, cold, and electricity

20, and the following spell-like abilities: at will-ethereal

jaunt, invisibility; 3/day-insanity, mage's disjunction, wish.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Boiling Sea (Su) As a standard action, a ghawwas can cause

the waters around it to boil. Any creature within 50 feet of

the ghawwas, within the same body of water, and at least

half submerged takes 6d6 points of heat damage (DC 22

Fortitude save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round

for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Rough Hide (Ex) Ghawwas have rough hides studded with

jagged barbs and spiny protrusions. Any creature striking a

ghawwas with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike takes

1d6 points of slashing and piercing damage.

Full of poison and treachery, ghawwas foul the seas and seek

to bring ruin to those who dwell there. Ghawwas resemble

a mixture of hulking humanoid, prehistoric fish, and

poisonous bottom-feeder. While most ghawwas live in salt

water, they sometimes teleport to oases to defile them or

suck them dry. Although they see all mortals as enemies,

ghawwas bear a particular grudge against peaceable, waterbreathing

creatures such as merfolk and locathah.

All ghawwas find the tolling of bells insufferable, the

sound filling them with rage and driving them to seek out

the source and destroy either the bell or those ringing it.

The typical ghawwas stands 12 feet tall and weighs close

to 1,200 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Disease (Su) A pairaka carries two

diseases. Its claws infect targets with

bubonic plague, and any willing contact

with its skin (such as through caressing,

grappling, or more) exposes victims to

the shakes.

Bubonic Plague: Claw-injury;

save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day;

frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str

damage, 1 Cha damage, and

target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Shakes: Contact; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency

1/day; effect 1d8 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Lustful Dreams (Su) Pairakas can torment sleeping creatures.

While an intelligent creature sleeps, a pairaka can slip into

the target's mind and twist its dreams to lusty nocturnal

visions. The victim must be asleep for the pairaka to use this

ability and the pairaka must be within 100 feet. If the victim

fails a DC 21 Will save, it experiences vivid hallucinations

of a lurid nature that leave it breathless and fatigued upon

waking. The victim, even a depraved soul, rarely considers

the sexual nature of these dreams enjoyable, as the images

exploit any number of taboos the pairaka suspects its victim

might harbor. The save DC is Charisma-based. Creatures

that do not sleep or dream are immune to this effect.

A sensual pairing of seduction and destruction, pairakas

embody the corruptive nature of unbridled lust. Pairakas

spend little time in their true form while on the

Material Plane, choosing to cloak

themselves instead in alluring

forms to seduce potential victims,

ruin relationships, and foment

obsession. In its true form, a

pairaka's body is a foul landscape

of blazing rashes, oozing pustules,

and taut blisters suggestive of the

corruptions it harbors, bodily and

spiritually.

Pairakas pride themselves on

perversion. They love nothing

more than turning lovers against

one another or destroying the bonds

of friendship. Pairakas feed off this

slow torment and savor each broken heart

or disappointment. They use lust and

sexuality as their primary tools, wielding

taboos and carnal appetites to sever oncefriendly

relationships. Pairakas also

use their seduction to spread disease,

charming victims into physical contact.

Just as all other divs suffer a weakness,

pairakas cannot stand the color red.

They never wear the color or enter

a place that is painted red,

and they always attack

creatures that are

garbed in clothes

of a crimson

hue f irst.

Pairakas stand 6 feet tall and weigh

around 150 pounds. Their skin color

varies widely between individuals.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Deflect Rays (Su) Once per round as an immediate action, a

sepid can use its Deflect Arrows feat to deflect a ray or a

spell that uses a ranged touch attack.

Rain of Debris (Su) Three times per day as a standard action,

a sepid can call forth a hail of stones, wood,

metal, and similar debris. The debris

rains down and pelts all creatures

in a 10-foot-high, 40-foot-radius

cylinder centered on the

sepid, dealing 15d6 points of

bludgeoning damage (Reflex

DC 25 for half ). This attack

does not harm the sepid, and

counts as an evil attack for the

purpose of damage reduction. The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Warlords among the divs,

sepids spread fear, slaughter,

and despair wherever they pass.

They foster battles,

incite rebellions, and

seek heroes to slay,

destroying all that which

gives common people

hope. With their falchions

in hand, sepids often stand

at the fore of the foul legions

they raise.

Sepids delight in twisting the

truth, but while all divs are

liars, sepids make themselves

predictable by always

doing the opposite

of what they claim,

and wise opponents

turn this knowledge to their

own advantage.

Sepids stand 13 feet

tall and weigh upward

of 1,500 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Consume Essence (Su) A shira's

deadliest attacks drain away a portion of its victim's

essence. Whenever a shira hits with a coup de grace attack

using its bite, or confirms a critical hit with its claws or

bite, the target must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save

or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain. The save is

Constitution-based.

Dusty Pelt (Ex) A shira collects and produces copious amounts

of dust and ash within the coarse hairs of its furry hide. As

a move action, it can shake itself, creating a cloud of dust

that fills its space, providing it concealment. Any attack that

deals at least 10 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing

damage to the shira (before DR) automatically activates

this ability. The dust cloud lasts for 1 round. A light wind

disperses this cloud immediately.

Bestial stalkers, shiras live to hunt and feed. Resembling

anthropomorphic lionesses, these divs use their powerful

builds, keen senses, and deadly instincts to track the

proudest mortals and slay the most formidable foes. They

embody the deadly nature of the wilds and the dispassion

with which beast and land might turn against mortals,

delighting in proving to civilized beings how small and

helpless they are in the face of a savage world.

Shiras prefer hunting alone, keeping company with

even others of their own kind only long enough to form

temporary hunting bands. With a hunger for intelligent

prey, they savor the taste of mortal souls, savaging

not just victims' bodies but also their vital

essences. Despite being the most feral of

all divs, shiras sometimes serve as

scouts and assassins for div hordes.

Such arrangements usually prove

to be temporary, however, lasting

only until the shiras' savage

instincts or lust for the hunt

again takes hold.

Shiras never go after

an easy kill, and instead

target the most obviously

powerful of the possible

targets. When acting on

this compulsion, a shira

weighs its chances for

survival and the glory of

its intended kill, planning

its tactics carefully and not

necessarily charging savagely

forth. Though savage, a shira is also

a cunning hunter and might wait

weeks for the perfect opportunity

to bring down its chosen prey.

Most shiras stand 10 feet tall and weigh approximately

1,200 pounds.

An eidolon is usually tied to a summoner who forges an

unbreakable link with a being not of his world, calling

upon it and sending it back to its otherworldly home as he

needs. When a summoner dies, this link is destroyed and the

eidolon is banished back from whence it came. Occasionally,

however, this link between eidolon and summoner is

unnaturally severed, usually as a result of powerful magic or

some bizarre death, freeing the eidolon upon the world. Few

can predict what specific events might cause an eidolon to

become unfettered, but those that do become stranded on a

plane alien to them, released to act as they please. An eidolon

that loses its link to its summoner loses its link to its home

realm, and many unfettered eidolons go mad, the glowing

runes that once represented their bonds burning painful

scars onto their bodies. Unfettered eidolons are not quite as

powerful as normal eidolons, but without their evolutions

tied to their summoners' whims, these bizarre and varied

creatures continue to evolve and advance on their own.

CREATING AN UNFETTERED EIDOLON

Unfettered eidolons can take on many shapes and sizes.

The stats presented here are for a


	SIZE:M


	unfettered

eidolon with the serpentine base form and 15 evolution

points, but an eidolon can take almost any form. An

unfettered eidolon has one of four base forms: aquatic,

biped, quadruped, or serpentine. Each base form

determines an eidolon's speed, good and bad saves, and

ability scores, and allots 5 evolution points to starting

evolutions (the bonuses from these starting evolutions

are already factored into the starting STATISTICS

	BONUS:STAT|CON|0


	BONUS:STAT|INT|0

form starts at

	size. An unfettered eidolon can

increase to


	SIZE:L


	size or larger by spending additional

evolution points (see below).

Aquatic Base Form:

An unfettered eidolon begins with 1 Hit Die, a +2

natural armor bonus, and the evasion ability. As an

unfettered eidolon's Hit Dice increase (see Evolution

Points, below), it gains additional bonuses and abilities.

At 2 Hit Dice, and every 3 HD thereafter, an unfettered

eidolon's base armor bonus increases by +2. This bonus

may be split between an armor bonus and a natural

armor bonus. Also at 2 Hit Dice, and every 3 HD

thereafter, an unfettered eidolon adds +1 to both its

Strength and Dexterity scores. At 5 Hit Dice, and every 4

HD thereafter, an unfettered eidolon adds +1 to any one

of its ability scores. At 7 Hit Dice, an unfettered eidolon

gains Multiattack as a bonus feat.

Evolution Points

Unfettered eidolons have a number of evolution points

(EP) you can use to purchase abilities and defenses in

addition to those presented above. An unfettered eidolon

starts with 8 EP, regardless of its base form. For each

additional EP spent beyond 8, an unfettered eidolon's Hit

Dice increase by 1. An unfettered eidolon's


	CR:increases

with its Hit Dice, as outlined on Table 1-2 on page 291

of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary using the "outsider" line.

Many of these abilities are universal monster rules

detailed starting on page 292 of this book.

Treasure standard (dagger, shortbow with 20 arrows,

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Panpipes (Su) Three times per day, a faun can use its

masterwork panpipes to augment its spell-like abilities.

Doing so is a swift action that increases the DC of the next

spell-like ability it uses on its turn by +2.

Often mistaken for satyrs, fauns are far more benevolent

than their unpredictable cousins. Many people use the

two names interchangeably, a fact that irritates both

fauns and satyrs. The vast majority of fauns are male,

although unlike satyrs, females of this species do exist-

they're simply less common than male fauns.

While satyrs breeding with their seduced victims always

produce full-blooded satyrs, fauns are the result of a willing

pairing between satyrs and goodly fey or kindhearted

humanoids such as humans or elves. Even in this case, the

babies of such unions are usually stolen away and raised by

their fey parent or some other sylvan foster family.

Like satyrs, fauns enjoy wine, music, dancing,

nature, and carnal pleasures. Gentle hedonists, fauns

also have a dedicated connection to the countryside,

helping hardworking humanoids who make peace with

the land and take little more than they need. They help

these frontier folk by fighting off significant threats

and keeping less savory fey creatures away from their

settlements. While they prefer to go unnoticed, in dire

times a band of fauns may present themselves to villagers

to warn their neighbors of an upcoming threat.

Fauns find nymphs exceptionally attractive, more so

than all others who dare view them. Nymphs find beauty

in fauns' good nature and steadfast dedication to the

natural world, and often humor their advances before

almost accidentally falling in love with them.

As tall as a human, a faun stands on stark white goat

legs and has short horns protruding from its head. It also

has a short tail that swishes playfully when it is excited

or entertained, and its hair falls

gracefully around its horns

and ears. Its humanoid

torso is always lithe but

chiseled because of its

constant activity and

play-fauns rarely

laze about too

long. Fauns stand

nearly 6 feet tall and

weigh little more

than 150 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Charging Trip (Ex) A festrog that hits with its bite after

making a charge attack on all fours can attempt to trip its

opponent (+4 bonus). This trip does not provoke attacks

of opportunity.

Diseased Pustules (Ex) When a festrog takes damage from

a piercing or slashing weapon, some of its boils rupture,

squirting the attacker with puslike fluids. The noxious

secretions carry a potent contact disease that causes those

infected to break out into painful necrotic boils.

Necrotic Boils: Disease-contact; save Fort DC 11; onset 1

day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con; cure 1 save.

Feed (Su) Every time a festrog makes a successful bite attack,

it feeds on its opponent's flesh and gains 5 temporary hit

points. The festrog cannot have more than 5 temporary hit

points gained by this ability at one time.

Four-Footed Run (Ex) A festrog can run on all fours at speed

of 50 feet if it doesn't hold or carry anything in its hands.

When running on all fours, it is treated as if it had the

Run feat.

A festrog is an undead abomination spawned when a

creature is killed by a massive release of negative energy

(perhaps due to planar bleeding, the destruction of a

potent artifact, or even certain magical attacks by powerful

undead), and then mutilated by an outside force, such as

the scavenging of wild animals. Sometimes called dogghouls

for their ability to run on all fours, the name often

causes opponents to misinterpret this creature's abilities

and grossly underestimate its intelligence, for the festrog

is in fact a rather canny monstrosity.

Festrogs inhabit remote areas near places where they

were slain. It's not uncommon for a tribe of festrogs to

share territories with ghouls. Most festrogs gather in small

bands, based on whatever loose affiliations they might

recall from when they were alive, and choose dwellings

in sunless areas easily defended with group tactics. Like

ghouls, they tend to skulk about graveyards, though they

prefer ones with tombs and mausoleums so they can

hide during the day. They hunt nocturnally in packs,

preferring open areas like plains, farmlands, or open

forests where they can track down prey with few places for

it to run or hide. These packs wander seminomadically,

often traveling miles beyond their dwellings in pursuit of

mortal f lesh.

Fey creatures resemble the mundane creatures they derive

from, but with brighter colors, delicate features, and elegant

wings such as those of a pixie or sprite. Despite their fragileseeming

appearance, fey creatures are every bit as hardy as

their non-fey relations, though they sacrifice raw might for

grace and the ability to f ly. They live long lives, barring death

by misadventure, and rarely show outward signs of age.

Some fey creatures owe their nature to fey ancestors

interbreeding with mortal beings, while others are races in

their own right. Still others began life as ordinary creatures

and were infused with fey essence through the magic of

learned spellcasters or the inf luence of ancient powers of

nature. As a rule, fey creatures rarely dwell in civilized lands,

both by preference and because the conditions that give

rise to the fey rarely occur in urban surroundings. If not

already born into realms of primeval wild or areas touched

by great fey powers, fey creatures soon seek them out.

Though more prone to mischief than mayhem, fey

creatures run the gamut from inimical to sprightly in

behavior. Those inclined toward play and jest take a dim

view of interlopers lacking in good humor. Such foultempered

intruders risk humiliation at best if they insult

the fey, and much worse if they raise arms against them.

More aggressive fey still possess a well-developed though

sadistic sense of humor. Such wicked fey use their inborn

powers to lure outsiders to their doom, rather than into

mere inconvenience.

Fey creatures generally have cordial relationships with

animals, allies of nature such as druids, and other fey.

Exceptions exist where rival communities of fey dwell in

proximity to one another. In these cases, any fey creatures

in the vicinity ally with one side or the other according

to their own inclinations, only rarely standing outside such

conf licts. Fey creatures derived from horses and the like

often serve as mounts, though only to other fey or to allies

of nature who acknowledge them as at least near-equals, if

not full partners.

Camouf lage (Ex) A fey creature can use Stealth to hide

in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not

grant cover or concealment. It gains a +4 racial bonus on

Stealth checks. This bonus does not stack with any racial

Stealth bonus possessed by the base creature.

Change Shape (Su) A fey creature can change shape into

a single form. Possible forms include a normal specimen

of its base creature, a humanoid creature within one size

category, or an animal within one size category. In all

cases, the fey creature appears as the same individual of

its alternate form each time it changes shape. The type

of polymorph spell used should be chosen as appropriate

based on the alternate form, such as alter self for taking

humanoid form. This ability can be selected more than

once, granting an additional form each time.

Energy Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains resistance 10

to one energy type, or increases an existing resistance by

10. Resistance increased beyond 30 becomes immunity

instead. This ability can be selected more than once.

Evasion (Ex) A fey creature gains evasion, as the rogue

ability of the same name.

Long Step (Su) A fey creature can teleport up to 10 feet

per Hit Die as a move action. It may use this ability once

every 1d4 rounds.

Spell Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains SR equal to 11 +

its CR. This does not stack with any existing SR possessed

by the base creature.

Trackless Step (Ex) A fey creature does not leave a trail in

natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. It can choose

to leave a trail, if it so desires.

Vanish (Su) As a swift action, a fey creature can vanish for

1 round as if affected by invisibility. It can use this ability for

1 round per day per Hit Die.

Woodland Stride (Ex) A fey

creature can move through

any sort of undergrowth

(such as natural thorns,

briars, overgrown areas, and

similar terrain) at its normal

speed and without taking damage

or suffering any other impairment.

Thorns, briars, and overgrown

areas that have been magically

manipulated to impede

motion still affect it.

Optionally, this ability may

function in a different type

of terrain, to allow the fey

creature to move through,

swamps, rocky areas, ice,

and so forth. Whatever

the choice, this ability

only functions in one

type of terrain. This ability can be selected more than

Spell-Like Abilities: A fey creature with an Intelligence

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Mucus (Ex) As a free action, a flail snail can

excrete a trail of mucus that covers its

space and lasts for 10 minutes. This

mucus comes in two types: slimy and

sticky. A character who attempts to move

through an area covered in

slippery mucus must make

a DC 14 Reflex save each

round or fall prone. Sticky

mucus transforms squares into

difficult terrain. Only one type

of mucus can be in effect at a time

in any one square. Flail snails can move

through either type of slime with ease. A square

of mucus exposed to a fire source dries and reverts to

normal. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Retraction (Ex) A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts into its shell

as a swift action, increasing its natural armor

bonus by +6, but it cannot move or

attack while retracted. It can return

to normal as a free action.

Slime Rope (Ex) A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike

strand up to 60 feet long, and can use this rope to hang itself

and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the ceiling indefinitely,

or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per round. It can

climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once

the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes

in 1d4 rounds. While the slime rope exists, other creatures

can climb the rope with a DC 20 Climb check.

Suction (Ex) A flail snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its

10-foot climb speed applies even to perfectly sheer surfaces

and ceilings, with no chance of the flail snail falling off unless

it is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a grapple.

Warp Magic (Su) Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is

an 80% chance that it produces a random effect instead of

affecting the snail. Only spells that directly target the flail

snail are warped; area effect spells are not affected. If a spell

is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table.

1-3 Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the

caster must make a DC 15 concentration check to

successfully cast spells.

4-6 Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is

affected as if the spell had been cast on it instead.

7-9 Spell fails. Nothing happens.

10 Spell rebounds on caster (as spell turning).

Flail snails are intelligent gastropods that subsist on

fungus, mold, and vermin, though they may attack larger

creatures in self-defense. Known for their magic-warping

shells and club-like tentacles, f lail snails roam slowly

through subterranean caverns writing great epics

in their slime trails.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Acid Injection (Ex) When a flumph strikes an opponent with

its spikes, it injects a burning, irritating acid that deals 1d4

points of acid damage immediately and another 1d4 points

of acid damage on the round after the attack. The target can

end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water

for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check.

A creature that grapples or swallows the flumph takes this

acid damage automatically every round it maintains this

contact with a living flumph.

Stench Spray (Ex) A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foulsmelling

liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions

like the stench universal monster ability, except it only

affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make

a DC 10 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The

save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph

can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet.

To use this version of its stench spray, the flumph must

succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most flumphs). If

the target is hit, it must make a DC 10 Fortitude save or

become nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for

5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and

on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected

at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can

smell it at double this range).

Come from distant stars to protect unprepared worlds from

cosmic horrors, f lumphs are jellyfish-like creatures that

f loat in the air and hunt with acidic spikes growing from

their undersides. Gentle at heart, f lumphs understand that

their appearance often terrifies viewers, and thus conceal

themselves and observe neighboring settlements from

afar, only revealing themselves when absolutely necessary.

They also know full well the limitations of their fragile

forms, and rather than directly opposing the horrors they

seek to defeat, they prefer to recruit and advise heroes to

tackle these dangerous tasks instead.

Flumphs f loat and speak via a constant f low of air

through tiny pores in their white bodies, emitting a

rhythmic puffing whenever they're aloft. Typical f lumphs

weigh 15 pounds and are 3 feet across. Flumphs deeply

revere dreams, seeing them as omens and portents. While

they normally mate and reproduce on the world of their

birth, f lumphs occasionally engage in a ritual called the

Seeding, in which seed pods are f lung into outer space in

order to provide other planets with guardians.

Foo creatures are benevolent guardian spirits that hail

originally from the Outer Plane of Nirvana, where they

spend their days cavorting in the idyllic wilds or aiding

that realm's inhabitants, particularly the agathions,

in their work. Yet while they come from Nirvana, foo

creatures are often encountered on the Material Plane as

well, for they are favorite conjurations of many cultures

and religions.

Countless species of foo creatures exist-for if an

animal dwells upon the Material Plane, it is certain

that somewhere in the vast wilds of Nirvana its spiritual

double frolics and plays. Nonetheless, certain foo

creatures are more common than others, and the most

often encountered of all are dogs and lions.

A foo creature can be called to the Material Plane for

any reason a conjurer can imagine-these monsters are

generally much more intelligent than their mundane

counterparts, and can not only follow complex orders but

can speak and converse as well. Typically, a foo creature is

contacted to serve for a time as a guardian-by adopting

its statue form using its freeze ability, a foo creature can

appear as little more than an ornate decoration astride

the facade of a building or standing guard over a fountain

in a city plaza. They are not as often called upon to serve

as soldiers in armies, for foo creatures detest war. They

generally dislike serving as mounts as well, although for

particularly pious and kindly folk, they have been known

to make exceptions.

to any animal, referred to hereafter as the base creature.

Defensive Abilities: A foo creature retains all of the

base creature's defensive abilities and special qualities. It

also gains the following.

Damage Reduction (Ex): A foo creature gains DR/

bludgeoning based on its Hit Dice. A foo creature with up

to 10 HD gains DR 5/bludgeoning. A foo creature with 11

or more HD gains DR 10/bludgeoning.

Paired Protectors (Su): When two or more foo creatures

are within 30 feet of one another, they both gain the

benef it of a protection from evil spell. The caster level of

this protection from evil effect is equal to the highest Hit

Dice of the affected foo creatures. This effect can be

dispelled, but if it is, a foo creature can reactivate it as

a swift action.

Stony Defense (Su): A number of times per day equal to its

Hit Dice, a foo creature can harden its skin to unyielding

stone as an immediate action. It gains hardness 8 until

the end of its next turn, but its speed is reduced by 10 feet

for the same duration.

Special Abilities: A foo creature retains all of the base

creature's special attacks and special abilities. It also

gains the following special quality.

Freeze (Ex): A foo creature can hold itself so still it

appears to be a statue. A foo creature that uses freeze can

take 10 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a

stone statue. A foo creature can maintain this position

for as long as it wishes.

Abilities: +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence.

Feats: All foo creatures gain Iron Will as a bonus feat.

Languages: All foo creatures speak Common and Celestial.

CREATING AN IMPERIAL FOO

CREATURE

Among foo creatures there exist what are known as

the "imperials"-the leaders of particular races of

foo creatures. Imperial foo creatures are much more

powerful than the typical examples of their kind, and

possess a wide array of additional magical powers. Each

imperial foo creature is a unique entity; only one exists

at any one time. When an imperial foo creature is

slain, the next most powerful foo creature of its

species immediately transcends to this role to

replace the one that was lost.

you'll go through to create the imperial version of

that foo creature are more akin to those you'd go

through to advance a creature by Hit Dice rather

than a standard template.

Step One-Increase Ability Scores: Upon becoming

an imperial, the foo creature gains a +6 bonus to all of

its ability scores, save for Intelligence, which increases to

20 (unless the +6 increase would normally increase its

Intelligence to an even higher score, in which case use that

score instead).

Step Two-Advance Hit Dice: An imperial foo creature

always has at least double the original foo creature's Hit

Dice-you can give the imperial foo creature even more

Hit Dice than this if you want to make a particularly

powerful one. Base attack bonus, saves, skill ranks, feats,

and all other variables dependant upon Hit Dice change

as normal.

Step Three-Increase Size: Increase the foo creature's

size by one category, applying the modifiers for size

changes as summarized on Table 2-2 on page 296 of the

Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.

Step Four-Spellcasting: An imperial foo creature

casts spells as a 10th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells

from the cleric list as well as those normally available to

a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for

an imperial foo creature. The imperial foo creature gains

Eschew Materials as a bonus feat, but gains no other class

ability normally granted by the sorcerer class.

Organization solitary, pair, or patch (3-5)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Acid (Ex) A garden ooze excretes digestive acid that can

dissolve flesh. Creatures made of harder materials or plant

matter are immune to the ooze's acid.

Camouflage (Ex) A garden ooze is difficult to spot when it is

at rest among plant growth of any type. A DC 15 Perception

check is required to notice the ooze is a separate entity and

not a diseased portion of the plant it rests upon. The ooze

automatically hits with a slam against any creature that fails

to notice the ooze and enters its square.

Stink (Ex) Once every 24 hours, a garden ooze can release

foul-smelling gases in a 5-foot-radius spread centered on

the ooze. The ooze usually does so after it is first injured.

The stench of these vapors is overpowering during the first

round it exists, causing living creatures within it to become

sickened for 1d3 rounds (Fort DC 13 negates). This is a

poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A garden ooze is an animate, acidic mass of

protoplasmic goo that dwells among foliage and

scavenges proteins in the form of carrion or small

animals that blunder into its vicinity. Although

garden oozes are occasionally found in underground

regions near the surface-such as sewers, sinkholes,

and shallow caves-these oozes prefer the outdoors.

One reason for this is that garden oozes are attracted

to large collections of organic material where other tiny

creatures might come to scavenge.

Quick and cunning hunters when compared to most

oozes, garden oozes are particularly dangerous because

they readily attack creatures that wander nearby regardless

of the creatures' size. Oozes that sense prey moving closer

are likely to wait to attack until the potential meal is

within reach. The oozes also give chase when prey f lees.

Garden oozes innately change hue to match the ground

underneath them, so they can be hard to spot.

When a garden ooze attacks, it lashes out with a

whiplike appendage coated with a potent f lesh-eating

acid. If injured, the ooze releases a disgusting stench that

makes it harder to fight off. Further, when one garden

ooze attacks, any other garden oozes nearby join in,

piling on and making escape all but impossible.

Fortunately for larger potential prey, most garden oozes

are quite small, the largest among them reaching 3 feet in

diameter before they split into smaller oozes. These oozes

are also known as rat-catcher oozes or compost oozes, and

some brave gardeners actually encourage the growth of

such oozes in their gardens as a way to combat pests. Once

the pests are under control, however, the oozes themselves

must be hunted and slain before the garden is safe to tend.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Bloodsense (Su) A ghorazagh notices living creatures within

60 feet just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.

Bloodspray (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a ghorazagh can

unleash a 20-foot cone of blood and eldritch enzymes. Any

living creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray must

make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be affected as by the spell

slow. A slowed creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray

a second time must make an additional save or be

paralyzed. These effects last for 2d6 rounds. A ghorazagh

can also consciously alter its enzymes, producing a spray

that removes all effects of this ability. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Chemical Communication (Ex) Ghorazaghs can

communicate with other ghorazaghs within

60 feet via pheromone transmission. In a

ghorazagh hive, this range extends to cover the

entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of

communication that only ghorazaghs can understand.

Ghorazaghs-or gore weavers-f loat like tumorous

specters through the deepest, most alien cavities of

the lightless underground, preying upon the wretched

vermin of those horrid places. Cunning, with minds

and drives unknowable and obscene to those of lands

above, the gore weavers only recently became aware of

the fertility and bounty of the surface world and are now

slowly turning their ebon eyes upward.

While ghorazaghs can digest nearly anything, they are

incapable of digesting blood. Their digestive systems

process f lesh, bone, and all other organic material,

filtering out blood and storing it in large reservoirs

within their bodies, whereupon the blood is mixed

internally with mucus and other strange f luids to form

a thick, gluelike substance. While a ghorazagh can spray

this f luid as an attack to impede prey, the primary use of

the foul substance is as a building material. Ghorazagh

hives are constructed entirely of this material, which

when it dries has the strength of metal while retaining

a dark red resinlike appearance. A ghorazagh hive is a

nightmare place as a result-twisting tunnels with an

eerily organic appearance that can wind for miles on end.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Cursed Claws (Ex) A ghul's claws count as

both cold iron and magic for the purpose

of bypassing damage reduction.

Genie-kin (Ex) For all race-related

effects (such as a ranger's favored

enemy), a ghul is considered a genie

even though its type is undead.

Ghuls are undead jann whose eternal existence was

twisted by fate and wrought through the displeasure of

Ahriman, Lord of the Divs. As if the curse of undeath and

ravenous hunger were not enough, these once-majestic

creatures now bear donkey hooves as feet. Despite their

horrific undead appearance, this feature shames them

the most, and they hide their feet from view.

Ghuls, like ghouls and ghasts, haunt cemeteries and

other places of the dead hoping to feed on corpses. They

also hunt mourners and grave tenders, as they enjoy the

taste of living prey as well as that of the dead. Selective

in their diets, ghuls choose their victims by personality,

believing innocence and youth taste more delicious than

the barely palatable f lesh of the bitter and old. Sometimes

a ghul follows a funeral procession in hyena form,

keeping a safe distance until the ceremony,

whereupon it changes into its true form to

attack and feast. Sorrow and despair taste as

delicious as innocence to a ghul.

While not directly affected by

sunlight, ghuls despise its presence

and only move about during the day if

forced to by necessity. They primarily

hunt at night, sometimes straying

far from their graveyard lairs and

burial caves in search of fresh prey

to sate their hunger.

The longer a ghul goes without

feeding, the more ferocious and

primal the creature becomes. A

well-sated ghul organizes with

others of its kind and lesser

undead, tormenting nearby

towns and settlements. A

ghul involved with this

level of organization

often has a scattered

set of lairs throughout

the desert. These allow

the ghul to strike far from

its home lair and hide again

without having to travel during

the blistering daylight sun.

When a ghul goes for too long

without feeding, it becomes

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Disease (Su) While ash giants are immune to

disease, they carry a contagious form of

leprosy. Any creature struck by an ash giant's

attacks is exposed to this virulent sickness.

Ash Leprosy: Injury; save Fort 23;

onset 1 minute; frequency 1 day; effect

1d2 Con damage, 1d2 Cha drain; cure

2 consecutive saves. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Oversized Weapon (Ex) An ash giant

can wield


	SIZE:H


	weapons without penalty.

Vermin Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild

empathy ability, save that it works only on vermin. An ash

giant gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice

(+14 for most ash giants). Vermin are normally mindless,

but this empathic communication imparts upon them a

modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the ash giant

to train vermin and use them as guardians (although it does

not grant them skills or feats).

Whether because of disruptive magic, unearthed deep

elements, or alien technology that fell calamitously from

the sky, ash giants are victims of their barren terrains. Yet

they somehow survive and even thrive in these desperate

lands. Ash giants have an uncanny ability to bond with

the enormous and often mutated vermin they share the

landscape with, and sometimes use the largest of these

creatures as mounts.

Ash giants are brash and violent, and their humor is

incredibly dark. Killing someone through a prank is just

as funny as tripping a friend while on a hunt. While not

inherently evil, lifetimes of being antagonized by

other tribes have practically bred violence into

their minds.

Ash giants are 10 feet tall

and weigh 1,200 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Axe Wielder (Ex)

All cave giants are

proficient with handaxes,

battleaxes, and greataxes.

Stooped over in a perpetual crouch, cave

giants move as if they had never mastered

walking erect. Their faces mix the worst features

of ogre and feral orc. The largest would measure 10 feet in

height if they ever stood straight. The typical cave giant

weighs 1,000 pounds. Though few survive past 60 years,

cave giants can live as long as 150 years.

While they prove remarkably adept with axes of all

varieties, cave giants lack the patience to work metal. What

metal a cave giant possesses was likely stolen from other

giants or worked by enslaved subterranean smiths.

Slaves such as dwarves, orcs, and troglodytes do most

of the labor in cave giant settlements. Poor treatment

and the need for meat keep slave populations small

and ever-rotating. New slaves are brought in whenever

raiding parties remember to reign in their blood lust. Any

prisoners who fail to submit to their new masters find

themselves served on the dinner table or tossed screaming

into the giant's cave lizard pens.

Giant lizards of all types serve as both guard beasts and

sport for the cave giants. Giant frilled lizards are rarely pets,

as most cave giants opt to keep less dangerous monitor lizards

instead. Kept in check only by fear and brutal beatings, such

pets turn on their handlers at the first sign of weakness. At

feeding time, live captives are tossed into the

pens, a festive event filled with boisterous

cheers and spirited betting.

Treasure standard (2 masterwork scimitars,

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Sandwalking (Ex) A desert giant travels at full

speed across sand, rocky ground, or dust, and leaves

no trail behind unless it chooses to.

Scimitar Training (Ex) All desert giants are proficient with

scimitars, and can wield them as if they were light weapons.

A desert giant adds its full Strength bonus to attacks made

with a scimitar wielded in its off hand, and gains a +4 bonus

to CMD versus disarm and sunder attempts when fighting

with a scimitar in each hand.

Desert giants rove the stark and majestic sands, rarely

dwelling in permanent camps. They roam from oasis to

oasis, sleeping beneath the stars or in easily dismantled

yurts, breaking camp as whim strikes or when food

sources grow scarce.

Desert giants stand 15 feet tall on average, but have slender

builds and rarely weigh more than 2,000 pounds, a fact that

greatly contributes to their grace and speed. The giants favor

loose robes with keffiyehs for protection from the scouring

desert winds, as well as traveling leathers worn beneath

the robes. They require little water, and are able to survive

for as long as 2 weeks on food alone. When such goods are

available, they drink water, milk, and juices in prodigious

amounts, but they spurn beer, wine, and stronger spirits.

The bulk of their diet comes from figs, olives, and similar

bounty of the oases, supplemented by meat if required. The

eldest desert giants live as long as 300 years.

Despite their nomadic ways, desert giants guard their

territory fiercely, driving away all interlopers, whether

intelligent or bestial.

Treasure standard (masterwork composite longbow [+8 Str]

with 40 arrows, other treasure)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Archery Expert (Su) A jungle giant is proficient with all bows, and

does not provoke an attack of opportunity when firing a bow

in melee combat.

Spell Storing (Su) Once per day as a immediate action, a jungle

giant can absorb a targeted or ranged touch spell used

against it, negating the effects against it but not against

any other targets. It can retain this stored power for up to

1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue fire.

If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee

or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a

free action, as if it were using a spell storing weapon. This

spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This

discharges the stored spell.

Warding Tattoos (Su) A jungle giant's magical tattoos grant it

a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The giant loses this

bonus if it wears armor.

Reclusive by nature, jungle giants lair deep within the

rainforest. These giants distrust the ways of civilization

and resent trespassers. More than one vine-covered lost

city in the deep jungle owes its fall to jungle giant ire.

The warrior-women of these tribes usually fight with

bows, sacred weapons often passed down over generations

from mother to daughter. To touch a jungle giant's bow

without permission is a mortal insult.

Jungle giants stand 17 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds.

Their barklike skin bears runic brands etched into each

giant as a rite of passage into adulthood. Jungle giant

tribes are matriarchal, ruled by an elder female warrior.

Males traditionally defend

the village, gather food,

tend livestock, and raise

children.

ability, save that it

works only on scorpions.

A girtablilu gains a racial

bonus on this check equal

to its Hit Dice (normally

+10). Scorpions are normally

mindless, but this empathic communication imparts

upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing

girtablilus to train scorpions and use them as guardians

(though it does not grant them skills or feats).

Girtablilus fiercely guard ancient places and treasures lost

to history. Far from civilized eyes, they thrive and piously

protect their charges with the aid of monstrously large

scorpions that girtablilus keep as pets.

All girtablilus share a zeal for religion, although the objects

of veneration vary from tribe to tribe. Some girtablilu tribes

still serve long-forgotten deities, preserving the divinities'

names and holy rituals. Others embrace religions derived

from prehistoric worship, devoted to the idea of gods that

once were or might never have been.

Girtablilu leaders are clerics or oracles, and are responsible

for the tribe's religious observances and laws. Tradition

and service to the group are important. Those who violate

tribal beliefs are killed or exiled into the harsh wasteland.

Girtablilus believe that no sacrifice in life (including death

in the service of the gods) goes unrewarded in the hereafter;

this belief makes them fierce and fearless fighters.

A girtablilu is 13 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Create Spawn (Ex) When a globster eats

a living creature, it only digests a

small portion of the remains. As the

undigested remains accumulate inside

of it, the globster grows more and

more bloated. As a full-round action that

does not provoke attacks of opportunity,

a globster can regurgitate these foul

remains along with portions of its own

mass. Doing so causes the globster

1d6 points of damage, but creates

a new, fully grown globster that

immediately attacks the nearest

non-globster target. A globster

can create spawn up to once per day,

though only after it has fed upon at

least four Medium-sized creatures

(or the equivalent number of

creatures of other sizes).

Decompose (Ex) A slain globster

decays into a mass of goo in

the span of 24 hours. However, the

corpse retains the creature's stench aura for 1d10 days after

its death.

Nausea (Ex) Any creature struck by a globster must make a DC

18 Fortitude save to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. Once

a creature makes this saving throw, it is immune to further

nausea effects from that particular globster for 24 hours. This

is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A globster is a living collection of half-digested parts from

large sea creatures such as whales and squid. Passersby

usually discover it by smell long before they see it. Many

unfortunate folk who happen upon a globster mistake it

for the carcass of a beached sea animal, getting too close

before discovering the seemingly dead creature is very

much alive. For a time, sages believed globsters were

undead-that they were simply undulating wads of rotting

f lesh animated with a drive to feed. However, globsters are

actually living creatures.

Globsters usually wash up on a beach or f loat to the shore

to feed on terrestrial stock for a few hours before returning

to the safety of water. Some say the tides and phases of the

moon are to blame for the times globsters come to land to

feed. Globsters reproduce by mixing parts of their own foul

bodies with the poorly digested remains of their meals.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Goblin Breath (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a

goblin snake can release a disgusting belch

as a standard action. Any creature within

5 feet of the goblin snake must succeed

at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened

for 1d6 rounds by the stench. Creatures

that successfully save cannot be affected

by the same goblin snake's goblin breath

for 24 hours. Goblin snakes and goblins

are immune to this effect. This is a poison

effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Snake Empathy (Ex) This ability functions similarly

to a druid's wild empathy ability,

but allows a goblin snake

to verbally communicate

with and be understood by

snakes and similar serpentine

reptiles. The bonus equals the

goblin snake's racial Hit

Dice plus its Charisma

modifier and a +4

racial bonus.

Tenacious predators and bullies, goblin snakes are shrill,

impulsive, and endlessly hungry. When their instinctual

cunning takes hold, however, these maniacal creatures

exhibit all the stealth and deadly cunning of serpents

coupled with the capricious destructiveness of goblins.

Cruel and selfish, goblin snakes care for little more

than their next meals and indulging their unfounded

arrogance. Like goblins, they can easily eat their body

weight in food daily, but goblin snakes are also lazy, and

are more likely to settle for easy meals rather than ones

they must work to find. As a result, goblins snakes eat

almost anything within reach and readily available, from

carrion to rubbish (the source of their horrendous and

nauseating breath). Goblin snakes delight in fresh meat,

but strongly prefer having others bring it to them over

hunting and killing it themselves.

Enjoying the company of snakes, goblin snakes are often

accompanied by several smaller venomous serpents, which

the goblin snakes use to protect their lairs and supplement

their food supply. Goblin snakes are exceedingly jealous

of nagas, however, envying their serpentine majesty and

mastery of magic. Enterprising and cunning goblin snakes

have been known to impersonate nagas, demanding tribute

and food from gullible creatures in awe of the "naga's"

supposed magical abilities. Some scholars have noted the

superficial similarities between goblin snakes and nagas,

and have gone as far as to theorize that the goblin snake

might be a particularly weak breed of naga-a theory that

most nagas do not appreciate at all.

Although goblin snakes are not as smart as

goblins, their terrifying shape allows them

to take positions of inf lated prominence

within goblin society. Fearful goblins

typically defer to the beasts, which

well suits the goblin snakes' innate

arrogance and sense of superiority.

Goblin snakes affiliated with goblin

tribes usually treat their goblin

associates as servants at best and

slaves at worst.

Goblin snakes share goblins' fear of horses

(who could easily step on and crush an

unwary goblin snake) and love of fire

(though their lack of arms gives them little

opportunity to indulge in arson), but they

are not as superstitious as goblins. Goblin

snakes eagerly embrace magic if given the

opportunity, and it is not uncommon

for a goblin snake with adept,

cleric, oracle, or sorcerer

class levels to serve as a

goblin tribe's shaman

or high priest.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Bone Prison (Ex) As a standard

action, a bone golem can throw

some of its bones at a creature

within 30 feet-it must make

a ranged touch attack to

hit. These bones magically

duplicate and form a cage

surrounding struck creatures.

Each round, the cage makes a

combat maneuver check to deal

the golem's slam damage, using the golem's

CMB. If the check fails, the target is still trapped but

takes no damage. The target can escape the grapple normally,

or can break out of the bones by dealing 15 points of damage to

the prison, which has the same AC, DR, and saves as the bone

golem itself. Damage to the prison has no effect on the golem.

The golem can only have one bone prison active at a

time. If it wishes to create a second one, it (or some

other creature) must first destroy the existing one.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A bone golem is immune

to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell

resistance. In addition, certain spells and

abilities function differently against the

creature, as noted below.

. Magical effects that heal living creatures slow a bone golem

(as the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds (no save).

. A magical attack that deals negative energy damage breaks any

slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3

points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the healing

would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it

gains any excess as temporary hit points. A bone golem gets no

saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage.

. A raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection spell negates

its DR and immunity to magic for 1 minute.

Bone golems are most often crafted as guardians of tombs-

and sometimes formed from the very corpses they guard.

CONSTRUCTION

The golem's body consists of bones from at least a dozen

Medium or larger skeletons. The bones must be treated

with oils and shellac worth 1,000 gp.

Brass Falchion (Ex) A brass golem's falchion deals damage as a

Huge falchion, but is actually a primary natural attack, not a

manufactured weapon, and cannot be disarmed.

Breath Weapon (Su) As a free action once every 1d4 rounds,

a brass golem can expel a cloud of smoke and cinders that

fills a 20-foot cube. This functions as an incendiary cloud that

persists for 1d6 rounds, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage (DC

20 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Death Throes (Ex) A brass golem explodes when it is

destroyed. All creatures within 30 feet of the golem take

12d8 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A brass golem is immune to any spell or

spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain

spells and effects function differently against the creature.

. A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a brass golem

(as per the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw.

. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any

slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of

damage for each 3 points of damage the attack

would otherwise deal. If the amount of

healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit

points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass

golem gets no save against fire effects.

Alloyed (Ex) A cannon golem's slam and cannon attacks

count as adamantine, cold iron, and silver for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Blasting Critical (Ex)

When a cannon

golem confirms

a critical hit with

a slam attack,

it can make one

cannon attack

against that target as a free action (as

long as the cannon is loaded).

Cannon (Ex) The golem's cannon has a range increment of

100 feet and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing

damage on a hit with a ?4 critical modifier. The cannon's

magazine can hold up to 20 cannonballs at a time-reloading

a single cannonball into this magazine is a standard action

for the golem, while loading a cannonball into the cannon

itself to fire it is a swift action; this allows the golem to take

two shots per round with the cannon.

Gun Training (Ex) A cannon golem adds its Dex

modifier to the damage dealt by its cannon.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A cannon golem is immune to

spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain

spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.

. Any spell with the water descriptor that affects a cannon

golem renders its cannon unusable for 1 round (no save).

. A heat metal spell causes the golem's cannon to instantly

backfire, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the golem and

staggering it for 1 round (no save).

A cannon golem's internal workings are a mechanical

labyrinth; its extradimensional pockets constantly process

new black powder. A cannon golem stands 12 feet tall.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Immunity to Magic (Su) A fossil golem is immune to any spell

or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition,

certain spells and abilities function differently against the

creature, as noted below.

. A transmute rock to mud spell slows a fossil golem (as the

slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.

. A stone to flesh spell negates its damage reduction and

petrification ability for 1 round.

Petrification (Su) The attacks of a fossil golem gradually turn

living flesh to stone. Each time the golem hits a target with

one of its natural attacks, the target must make a DC 19

Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. A

creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by this attack turns

completely to stone, as if by a flesh to stone spell. Casting

stone to flesh on the creature removes all Dexterity drain

caused by this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based

and includes a +2 racial bonus.

A fossil golem is constructed of the stony bones of longdead

dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. These

bones are generally not assembled with any attempt

to accurately model the original creature-usually,

the skulls of powerful predatory dinosaurs (such as

tyrannosauruses) serve in the place of hands, granting

the fossil golem a pair of devastating bite attacks. The

magical energies that infuse a fossil golem create an

additional peril-they transform fossilization into a

terrible form of contagion that can affect any

creature they damage.

Fossil golems are often used to guard caverns

and other natural fortifications. A fossil golem

at rest might look to the untrained eye like nothing

more than a strange display of bones. A fossil golem is

20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.

CONSTRUCTION

A fossil golem must be constructed from the

fossilized skeletons of at least two creatures of Huge

size or greater. The fossilized bone making

up the golem requires extensive

preservation and reassembly

with alchemical solutions

at a cost of 5,000 gp.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Breath Weapon (Su) Each of a

gorynych's heads has its own separate breath weapon. When

a gorynych uses its breath weapon, it can breathe with one,

two, or all three heads. If the areas of two or more breath

weapons overlap, a creature caught in that overlapping area

takes a -2 penalty on its Reflex save (or -4 if three breath

weapons overlap). Damage done by overlapping breath

weapons stacks and is considered to be a single source

of fire damage for the purpose of tracking fire resistance.

Regardless of how many heads breathe fire, the gorynych can

only use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds.

Multi-Headed (Ex) All three of a gorynych's heads can act

independently of each other. When it makes a full attack,

each head can either bite or use its breath weapon, in any

combination (two bites and one breath, three breaths and

no bites, and so on).

This sinister beast threatens entire countrysides with its

plundering actions. No friend to its true dragon cousins,

a gorynych sometimes threatens green and black dragons

for mastery of their lands. A gorynych seeks out young

dragons that have only established small hoards, killing

the rival creatures and claiming their treasures as its

own. It dominates drakes and wyverns, but

true dragons consider it a repulsive

throwback to an ancient line of mutants

and deviants.

Motivated by greed, gluttony, and

unnatural lust, a gorynych lives to collect

treasure, feast as often as possible, and

chase after humanoid maidens, using

alter self and charm person as necessary.

Gorynyches are particularly creative

with the use of their limited wishes in

duplicating other spell effects to

secure their desires and complete

their hideous tasks.

When not busily stalking

young dragons in order to

steal their hoard or selecting

maidens to kidnap, most

gorynyches search out

ancient ruins. There they

install themselves as

guardians, sometimes

even gathering whole

tribes of monstrous

humanoids to act

as their servants.

Undying tyrants and eternal champions of the undead,

graveknights arise from the corpses of the most

nefarious warlords and disgraced heroes-villains too

merciless to submit to the shackles of death. They bear

the same weapons and regalia they did in life, though

warped or empowered by their profane resurrection.

The legions they once held also f lock to them in death,

ready to serve their wicked ambitions once more. A

graveknight's essence is fundamentally tied to its armor,

the bloodstained trappings of its battle lust. This armor

becomes an icon of its perverse natures, transforming

into a monstrous second skin over the husk of desiccated

f lesh and scarred bone locked within.

CREATING A GRAVEKNIGHT

"Graveknight" is an acquired template that can be added

to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to

hereafter as the base creature). Most graveknights were

	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Default Traits ~  and abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as base creature +2.

Alignment: Any evil.

Type: The graveknight's type changes to undead

(augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.

Senses: A graveknight gains darkvision 60 ft.

Aura: A graveknight emanates the following aura.

Sacrilegious Aura (Su): A graveknight constantly exudes an

aura of intense evil and negative energy in a 30-foot radius.

This aura functions as the spell desecrate and uses the

graveknight's armor as an altar of sorts to double the effects

granted. The graveknight constantly gains the benefits

of this effect (including the bonus hit points, as this aura

is part of the graveknight's creation). In addition, this

miasma of fell energies hinders the channeling of positive

energy. Any creature that attempts to summon positive

energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel

energy ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with

the healing subtype-must make a concentration check

with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight's Hit Dice + the

graveknight's Charisma modifier. If the character fails,

the effect is expended but does not function.

Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4.

Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit

Dice are unaffected. As an undead, a graveknight uses its

Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points.

Defensive Abilities: A graveknight gains channel

resistance +4; DR 10/magic; and immunity to cold,

electricity, and any additional energy type noted by its

ruinous revivification special quality. A graveknight also

gains spell resistance equal to its augmented


	CR:+ 11.

The graveknight also gains the following ability.

Rejuvenation (Su): One day after a graveknight is

destroyed, its armor begins to rebuild the undead

horror's body. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body

is destroyed before that time passes, the armor merely

starts the process anew. After this time has elapsed, the

graveknight wakens fully healed.

Attacks: A graveknight gains a slam attack if the base

creature didn't have one. Damage for the slam depends

on the graveknight's size (see Bestiary 302).

138

Illustration by Chris Seaman

Special Attacks: A graveknight gains the following

special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the

graveknight's HD + the graveknight's Charisma modifier

unless otherwise noted.

Channel Destruction (Su): Any weapon a graveknight

wields seethes with energy, and deals an additional 1d6

points of damage for every 4 Hit Dice the graveknight has.

This additional damage is of the energy type determined

by the ruinous revivification special quality.

Devastating Blast (Su): Three times per day, the

graveknight may unleash a 30-foot cone of energy as a

standard action. This blast deals 2d6 points of damage

for every 3 Hit Dice a graveknight has (Ref lex for half ).

This damage is of the energy type determined by the

graveknight's ruinous revivification special quality.

Undead Mastery (Su): As a standard action, a graveknight

can attempt to bend any undead creature within 50 feet to

its will. The targeted undead must succeed at a Will save

or fall under the graveknight's control. This control is

permanent for unintelligent undead; an undead with an

Intelligence score is allowed an additional save every day

to break free from the graveknight's control. A creature

that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the

same graveknight's undead mastery for 24 hours.

A graveknight can control 5 Hit Dice of undead

creatures for every Hit Die it has. If the graveknight

exceeds this number, the excess from earlier uses of the

ability becomes uncontrolled, as per animate dead.

Special Qualities: A graveknight gains the following.

Phantom Mount (Su): Once per hour, a graveknight can

summon a skeletal horse similar to a phantom steed. This

mount is more real than a typical phantom steed, and can

carry one additional rider. The mount's powers are based

on the graveknight's total Hit Dice rather than caster

level. A graveknight's mount looks distinctive and always

appears the same each time it is summoned. If the

mount is destroyed, it can be summoned again with

full hit points 1 hour later.

Ruinous Revivification (Su): At the time of its creation,

the graveknight chooses one of the following energy types:

acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This energy type should be

relevant to the graveknight's life or death, defaulting to

fire if none are especially appropriate. This energy type

inf luences the effects of several of a graveknight's

special abilities.

Ability Scores: Str +6, Int +2, Wis +4,

Cha +4. As an undead creature, a

graveknight has no Constitution score.

Skills: Graveknights gain a +8 racial bonus on

Intimidate, Perception, and Ride checks.

Feats: Graveknights gain Improved

Initiative, Mounted Combat, Ride-By

Attack, and Toughness as bonus feats.

GRAVEKNIGHT ARMOR

In death, the graveknight's life force lingers on in its

armor, not its corpse, in much the same way that a lich's

essence is bound within a phylactery. Unless every part

of a graveknight's armor is ruined along with its body, a

graveknight can rejuvenate after it is destroyed. A typical suit

of full plate graveknight armor has hardness 10 and 45 hit

points, though armor with enhancements or made of special

materials proves more difficult to destroy. Merely breaking a

graveknight's armor does not destroy it; it must

be ruined, such as by being disintegrated,

taken to the Positive Energy Plane, or

thrown into the heart of a volcano.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Faith Bound (Su) A graven guardian cannot attack any creature

that openly wears or displays the holy or unholy symbol of

the deity to which the graven guardian is dedicated unless

that creature first attacks the graven guardian.

Magic Weapon (Su) A graven guardian that carries its deity's

favored weapon treats that weapon as a +1 weapon as long

as it is wielded by the guardian. If the weapon is a melee

weapon, it gains the keen weapon special ability (even if

the weapon is a bludgeoning weapon). If it is a thrown

weapon, it gains the returning weapon special ability. If it is

a ranged weapon, it gains the seeking weapon special ability,

and generates new ammunition with each attack (this

ammunition is destroyed whether or not it hits).

Graven guardians are human-sized constructs of clay,

stone, wood, or similar materials, crafted and painted to

resemble a deity or a deity's favored servants. When not in

motion, a graven guardian appears identical to a temple

or crypt's statue, but while active, graven guardians look

extremely lifelike.

Graven guardians are inexorably tied to a specific

deity's faith. While unintelligent and thus lacking any

real personality, a graven guardian has the ability to

recognize fellow worshipers or minions of its deity and

does not treat them as enemies unless they first attack.

This recognition does not extend so far as to allow these

worshipers (or those cunningly disguised as worshipers)

to give a graven guardian new orders. As with all

constructs, a graven guardian follows only the orders of

its creator.

GUARDIAN DOMAINS

Each graven guardian gains a special ability from two

domains assigned during construction. Save DCs for these

abilities are Wisdom-based (DC 14 for most guardians).

Caster level for these abilities is equal to the graven

guardian's Hit Dice (CL 5th for most graven guardians).

Air: Flight (Su)-The graven guardian gains a f ly speed

equal to its base speed with average maneuverability and

a Fly skill of +6 (this includes a +4 racial bonus).

Animal: Beast Ward (Su)-Animals must make a Will

save before they can attack the graven guardian. Any attack

on an animal (but not its allies) by the graven guardian

breaks this protection. Once the animal makes this Will

save, it need not save again against that particular graven

guardian on subsequent attacks.

Artifice: Repair (Ex)-The graven guardian's fast

healing increases to 5.

Chaos: Chaotic Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's

weapon and slam attacks are treated as chaotic-aligned. Its

magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to lawful targets.

Charm: Command (Su)-The graven guardian can cast

command three times per day as a spell-like ability.

Community: Alliance (Su)-Adjacent worshipers and

graven guardians dedicated to the same god gain a +1 luck

bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saves.

Darkness: Darkness (Su)-The graven guardian can cast

darkness two times per day as a spell-like ability.

Death: Bleed (Ex)-The graven guardian's weapon deals

2 points of bleed damage on a hit.

Destruction: Shatter (Ex)-The graven guardian can

cast shatter two times per day as a spell-like ability.

Earth: Rocky (Ex)-The graven guardian's natural

armor bonus increases by +2.

Evil: Evil Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon

and slam attacks are treated as evil-aligned. Its magic

weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to good targets.

Fire: Flaming (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon

gains the f laming property.

Glory: Glorious (Su)-The graven guardian's magic

weapon and slam attack deal an additional 1d6 points of

damage against undead creatures.

Good: Good Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's

weapon and slam attacks are treated as good-aligned. Its

magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to evil targets.

140

Illustration by Chris Seaman

Healing: Recovery (Su)-Once per day, when reduced

below half hit points, the graven guardian automatically

heals 3d10+6 points of damage.

Knowledge: Familiarity (Su)-The graven guardian gains

a +2 bonus on attack rolls again any creature it attacked in

the past round.

Law: Lawful Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapons

and slam attacks are treated as lawful-aligned. Its magic

weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets.

Liberation: Unfettered (Su)-The graven guardian gains a

+4 bonus to its CMD.

Luck: Lucky (Su)-Once per day, the graven guardian

may roll a saving throw twice and take the better of the

two results as the actual result.

Madness: Confusion (Su)-The graven guardian can cast

confusion once per day as a spell-like ability.

Magic: Resistant (Su)-The graven guardian's SR

increases by 5.

Nobility: Honored (Su)-The graven guardian gains a

+1 bonus on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks.

Plant: Entangle (Su)-The graven

guardian can cast entangle three times

per day as a spell-like ability.

Protection: Protected (Su)-The

graven guardian gains a +2 bonus

on all saves.

Repose: Rest Eternal (Su)-

Damage dealt by the graven

guardian resists any magical

healing. Attempting to use

magical healing to cure this

damage requires a successful

caster level check against

the guardian's SR. This

ability does not affect natural

healing or healing provided by

extraordinary abilities.

Rune: Rune Carved (Su)-Runes cover

the graven guardian. Whenever the graven

guardian takes energy damage or energy damage

fails to overcome its SR, for the next round, its attacks

deal +1d6 points of damage of that energy type. If more

than one type of energy attack occurs in a round, roll

randomly to determine what kind of extra energy damage

it deals.

Strength: Powerful (Ex)-The graven guardian gains

Power Attack as a bonus feat.

Sun: Dazzling (Su)-When the graven guardian

scores a critical hit with its magic weapon, a bright f lash

blinds the target for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude save negates).

Travel: Speedy (Su)-The guardian gains Mobility as a

bonus feat, and all of its modes of movement increase by

+10 feet.

Trickery: Trip (Su)-The graven guardian gains the trip

ability with its melee weapon and slam attacks.

War: Enhanced (Su)-The enhancement bonus of the

graven guardian's weapon increases to +2.

Water: Swimmer (Ex)-The guardian gains a swim

speed equal to its base speed, and a Swim skill of +11.

Weather: Shocking Weapon (Su)-The graven guardian's

weapon gains the shock special ability.

CONSTRUCTION

A graven guardian's body must be sculpted from clay,

stone, or wood, and adorned with precious stones, rare

woods, or metal inlays worth 500 gp. The Hit Dice and

Treasure standard (6 darts, other treasure)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Congeal Water (Su) Once per day, a fuath can surround a

creature in a thin layer of magically viscous water as a

standard action at a range of 30 feet. A target that fails

a DC 10 Reflex save becomes entangled and must hold

its breath or risk drowning. The target or an adjacent

creature can spend a full-round action on its turn

scraping off the clinging fluid, allowing a new Reflex

save with a +2 bonus; otherwise, the effect lasts for 1d4

minutes. A fuath can use this ability even if there is no

source of water nearby. The save DC is Charisma-based and

includes a +1 racial bonus.

Vulnerable to Sunlight (Ex) A fuath takes 1 point of Constitution

damage after every hour it is exposed to sunlight. Water of a

depth of at least 1 foot negates this harmful effect.

Drowners of sailors and sinkers of ships, a fuath (FOO-ah)

is a wicked gremlin found in the sea. It climbs aboard ships

in the dead of night to sever ropes, bore holes in barrels,

soil provisions, and murder any hapless crew it puts to

sleep or catches alone. It delights in drowning creatures

by surrounding them with magically thickened water,

cackling with wicked glee as its victims claw desperately

for the air only inches from their mouths.

A fuath wears seaweed, shells, and coral like other

creatures wear armor, clothes, and jewelry. Its body is

protected by a hard, hunchbacked carapace. It stands less

than 2 feet tall and weighs 12 to 15 pounds.

Fuaths don't share a common language with other types

of gremlins, though they can pantomime to each other fairly

effectively. They have a surprising rapport with other sea

creatures, even foul-tempered beasts like reefclaws (Bestiary

2 234).


	SIZE:S


	groups of fuaths lair in sea caves or rocky

crevices. Larger groups frequently lay claim to whole sections

of ruined ships. Their lairs usually include several trained

guard animals. Fuaths prefer the taste of "land-meat" to

anything from the sea, and often raid shore and ships to slake

their hunger. They adore sea hags to the point of worship.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Death Flood (Su) When a grodair is killed, it

immediately explodes in a 15-foot-radius

burst of highly pressurized water that

deals 5d6 points of damage (DC 17

Reflex for half ). After the explosion, a

successful DC 25 Survival check allows

a creature to recover a cluster of strange

organs from the remains. This cluster

functions as a decanter of endless water for

2d6 hours, but can only produce a "stream"

or "fountain" effect. Failing this Survival check

by 5 or more causes the cluster to burst, dealing

an additional 2d6 points of damage to

that creature (no save) and destroying

the organs entirely. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Muddy Field (Su) As a standard action when on

sand, soil, or other types of loose earth, a grodair

can gush standing water into the area surrounding

it. Upon doing so, the land within 15 feet of the

grodair is treated as a shallow bog (Core Rulebook 427). This

water remains as long as the grodair is within 15 feet and

wishes to maintain the water. The bog instantly disperses as

soon as the grodair is killed or moves out of the area.

Water Blast (Ex) The grodair's ranged attack is a pressurized

blast of water. This attack has a range of 60 feet with no

range increment.

A grodair is a bloated aquatic creature from the primal

world of the fey. The bulbous sac on its spine is an

extradimensional space that can contain thousands of

gallons of water. The creature drains water (including small

bits of debris and even very small creatures) from one place

and releases it in another, typically creating boggy areas

as it moves so it can travel more quickly than its tentacles

can carry it. A grodair can rise up to 6 feet on its tentacles,

measures 7 feet long, and weighs about 400 pounds.

A grodair is intelligent, but extremely absentminded

and careless. Its memory is poor, and it has difficulty

remembering things it was told even 5 minutes prior-

though it can recall some events of the

distant past with perfect (and

often frustrating) clarity.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Aquatic Elusion (Su) As

a standard action, a

grootslang that

is fully immersed in water can teleport to another body of

water without error. This ability functions like tree stride, but

the grootslang can exit from any body of water within 1 mile

so long as both the entry and exit are wide enough for the

creature to enter.

Impaling Bite (Ex) A grootslang can make a bite attack against

any creature it is grappling with its tail. If this attack hits, it

is automatically treated as a critical threat.

Thunderous Stomp (Ex) As a full-round action, a grootslang

can rear up on its serpentine body to bring its massive

forelimbs down with awesome force. The grootslang

chooses two adjacent targets to be affected as though

trampling them. In addition, each creature within 10 feet

must make a DC 28 Reflex save or be knocked prone. The

save DC is Constitution-based

Legends claim that the grootslang is a primordial creature

as old as the world itself. Such tales state that in those

ancient days, the gods-new to the crafting of things-

made a terrible mistake in the grootslang's creation, for

they gave it tremendous strength, cunning, and intellect.

Upon realizing their mistake, the gods split the grootslang

into separate creatures and thus created the first elephants

and the first snakes. But one of the original grootslangs

escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs were

born. Scholars debate the veracity of such stories, and

have looked to either biological or magical explanations

of the creature's origins, but nevertheless bards and sages

alike agree that the grootslang's fearsome

reputation is well deserved.

A grootslang's thick, leathery hide

has a metallic sheen and

a dull copper color, shot

through with thin

veins of green. Both

males and females grow

to a length of 60 feet and

stand 20 feet tall. Little

differentiation exists between

sexes save for a lighter green hue to the

female's hide. Grootslangs can weigh 20 tons

and live up to 500 years.

All grootslangs covet gems, particularly

diamonds, and despite the creatures' lust

for cruelty, victims can often bargain for

their freedom by offering a grootslang

enough precious gems.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Broken Ground (Su) The ground in a 30-foot

radius around a guecubu ripples and shudders

unnaturally. This transforms the area surrounding

a guecubu into difficult terrain. A guecubu can move

through this area with no penalty. Consecrated ground

cannot be affected by this ability, nor can any area warded

by a magic circle against chaos or a magic circle against evil.

Misfortune (Su) A creature struck by a guecubu must make

a DC 20 Will save or become permanently cursed with

misfortune. The victim of this curse takes a -4 penalty on all

attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and any critical

threat against the victim automatically confirms. If a guecubu

hits a creature already suffering from this curse, the victim

must make a DC 20 Will save or be staggered for 1 round.

This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Often when a particularly evil criminal is executed,

suspicious folk fear that the criminal's remains might

rise from death to continue to plague the living. To

combat this possibility, many mobs or rural justices take

to the practice of burning the bodies, grinding the bones,

and scattering the remains in the wild. Yet in the case of

particularly evil criminals, even these steps are in vain,

for their will is enough to reassemble a body from earth,

stone, roots, and plants drawn from the region into which

the remains were scattered. Such an undead horror rises

as a guecubu, a harbinger of misfortune and vengeance

from beyond the grave.

A newly formed guecubu remembers well how its

enemies treated it, and while the undead creature retains

none of its previous life's talents, its undead state grants it

many new tools to seek revenge with. Typically, a guecubu

does not limit its revenge to those directly involved with its

execution-entire villages and towns fall victim to its rage.

The guecubu's tactics tend toward the subtle, and it seeks to

spread misfortune and death on a person-by-person basis,

slaying its enemies one at a time until they f lee, so that all

that remains is a ghost town.

A guecubu is 6 feet tall and weighs

100 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Inhabit (Ex) A hellwasp swarm can enter the body

of a helpless or dead creature by crawling into its

mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting a body requires

1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large.

The swarm can abandon the body at any time as a full-round

action. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the

hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's DR,

resistances, and immunities may negate

some or all of this damage.

When a hellwasp swarm inhabits a

dead body, it effectively transforms the

corpse into a zombie of the appropriate

size under the swarm's control. If a hellwasp

swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the

effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement

and actions as if using dominate monster. Hellwasps quickly

consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution

damage per hour.

A hellwasp-inhabited creature is easy to spot, since its

skin crawls with the forms of the insects inside. A swarm

can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a

host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a


	SIZE:S


	host.

A remove disease or heal spell cast on an inhabited victim

forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.

Poison (Ex) Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round

for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Even Hell's fiendish inhabitants know to stay clear of the

maddening buzz of hellwasp swarms. While individual

hellwasps are mindless, when swarmed together they gain a

hive mind that torments the living and the dead alike. Sages

and diabolists argue as to why this happens, but a favored

explanation is that all hellwasps contain the dispersed

soul of some greater devil, scattered and imprisoned by

his rivals for infractions lost to mortal knowledge.

Though intelligent, these swarms are often difficult to

understand and reason with. A hellwasp swarm can speak

in a fashion with its myriad droning wings. The chatter

is often little more than repetitive mantras of insults and

the voicing of the twisted and base desires of the swarm.

A hellwasp swarm has little use for reason, diplomacy, or

discourse in other circumstances, for its desires are as

savage as its home plane.

Elk range in great herds throughout the plains, hills, and

forests of many wilderness areas. Their size, strength,

and antlers allow them to contend with most of their

environment's dangers, though herds generally favor

f light to combat. Elk also prove exceptionally adaptable

survivors, capable of living through severe

weather changes without concern. Most

breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall

and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with

females far slighter than the males.

Numerous species of elk exist. Some larger

species can stand up to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and can

be used as mounts by


	SIZE:M


	humanoids;

these elk have 3 Hit Dice and are Large.

One particularly unusual species of

elk, the river elk, is an excellent

swimmer-these elk gain a

swim speed of 30 feet. All

elk of this size are CR

2 creatures.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Spiked Tail (Ex) A hodag's tail spikes allow

the creature's tail slap to deal both

bludgeoning and piercing damage. A

hodag's tail slap is a primary attack.

Toss (Ex) A hodag charging 20 feet or more

that damages a foe with an attack can throw its

foe with a special combat

maneuver check. The

opponent must

be corporeal and

at least one size

category smaller

than the hodag. If

the combat maneuver

check succeeds, the

hodag's opponent is

thrown 10 feet through

the air in a direction

chosen by the hodag and

falls prone. The hodag can only

toss its opponent in a straight line.

If an obstacle prevents the creature's movement, both the

creature tossed and the object struck take 1d6 points of

damage, and the creature falls prone in the space adjacent to

the obstacle. A hodag can also toss an opponent 10 feet up

into the air. The victim lands in the same square it started in,

falls prone, and takes 1d6 points of damage.

Trackless (Ex) A hodag sweeps its tail behind itself in a way

that obscures its tracks. Attempts to track a hodag have

their normal DC increased by +10.

As stout as a bull with a reptile's scaly, spiked body, hodags

are legendary forest predators that hunt along the edges of

civilization in thick woods. Green, gray, and black scales

cover the beasts, helping them blend in amid underbrush,

and sharp spikes stand along their backs and run down

their powerful, dangerous tails. Loggers share stories of

being followed by hodags and seeing their glowing red

eyes in the otherwise oppressive darkness of the deep

forest. In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets the

region, hodags grow a foul-smelling coat of greasy, dark

brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between their scales.

Many believe that hodags are not simply strong beasts

but rather unique and specific terrors that have lived and

hunted certain woodlands for ages. Others living near

such wildernesses, however, consider hodags a myth,

nothing more than the sort of tall tale that is typical of

excitable rural folk. A male hodag measures 10 feet long

and weighs 700 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Channel Negative Energy

(Su) As a standard action,

a hollow serpent can channel negative energy in a 30-foot

burst as a 16th-level evil cleric. This ability requires no

divine focus. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Desiccation Aura (Su) A cloud of moisture-draining dust

fills the air in a 30-foot radius around a hollow serpent.

Living creatures within this area must make a DC 26

Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage

as water is leached from their flesh. Whether or not the

save is successful, a creature cannot be affected again by

the same hollow serpent's desiccation aura for 24 hours.

Creatures without fleshy bodies are immune to this

aura, while creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes

take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Life-Draining Coils (Su) A hollow serpent seethes with

negative energy capable of sapping the life force of

creatures trapped within its coils. Every time a creature

takes constriction damage from a hollow serpent, it

gains one negative level. The hollow serpent also gains 5

temporary hit points for each negative level it bestows.

Lifesense (Su) A hollow serpent notices and locates living

creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the

blindsight ability.

Swift Strike (Ex) When a hollow serpent takes

a full-attack action, it can make two bite

attacks instead of just one.

Crafted from the shed skins of great

snakes by serpentfolk necromancers

and other foul spellcasters, hollow

serpents are plagued by an eternal

hunger they can never sate. The

act of draining energy from living

creatures blunts these supernatural

pangs, driving the hollow serpent to

constantly seek new prey.

A hollow serpent is a difficult undead to

create-most of them were crafted

by a long-forgotten god of

the serpentfolk and not

by mortal spellcasters

at all. The exact

methods by which a

mortal might create

a hollow serpent

are obscure, but most

scholars have come to the

conclusion that the use of

powerful artifacts or the aid

of a demigod may be required

for such a feat.

A hollow serpent is 15 feet

long and weighs 500 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Aura of Faithlessness (Su) The

huecuva and all undead

creatures within 30 feet

receive a +2 profane bonus

on Will saves made to resist

channeled energy and positive

energy effects.

Disease (Ex) Filth fever: Injury; save

Fort DC 12; onset 1d3 days;

frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex

damage and 1d3 Str damage; cure 2

consecutive saves. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

False Humanity (Su) During the day,

a huecuva is cloaked in an illusion

that makes it look, sound, and

feel like the living creature

it once was. This effect

functions similarly to

disguise self-if a creature interacts directly with a huecuva,

it can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the illusion.

Regardless, the huecuva's scent never changes-it always

exudes a faint stench of grave dust and decay. Creatures

with the scent ability receive a +4 bonus on any Will saving

throw made to see through this illusion. At night (regardless

of whether the huecuva itself knows night has fallen) this

illusion fades and reveals the creature for what it truly is.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Huecuvas are the risen corpses of heretical clerics who

blasphemed and renounced their deities before meeting

death. In unlife, they hate and seek to destroy those pious

souls who keep their vows. Although easily mistaken

for zombies or even skeletons, huecuvas have a spark of

intelligence that makes them cunning and deceptive foes.

During daylight hours, a huecuva becomes shrouded in

an illusion that causes it to appear as it did in life-at

these times, a huecuva might seek to infiltrate society

to dwell among those it hates. When night falls, it

emerges to seek out its prey. Fortunately for the

living, the typical huecuva has only fragments

of intellect remaining, so it is usually not long

before the undead creature makes an error

of judgment or simply reveals itself for the

monster it is.

Most huecuvas remember little of their

former lives except for the blasphemies that

led them to their cursed fates. They often

find themselves drawn to the ruins of old

temples, where they rage against or seek

hopeless absolution from the deities who so

aff licted them. Huecuvas sometimes work

in concert with other undead creatures that

share the same area.

While most huecuvas arise when a god

rejects a heretic priest's soul, forcing the

slain to rise as horrible undead, a huecuva

can also be created with create undead. The

caster must be at least 11th level, and the

body to be transformed must have been

an evil cleric in life. The spell can be

used to create a huecuva using the

body of a nonevil

cleric, but doing so

requires a DC 20

caster level check.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Prismatic Aura (Su) As a swift action once per day, a

humbaba can activate its prismatic aura. Doing

so causes brilliant light to radiate from

the humbaba to a radius of 30 feet.

Each round at the start of the humbaba's turn, roll 1d8 and

consult the table of prismatic spray effects on page 325 of the

Core Rulebook to determine the color and effect of the light

(reroll results of 8). If a creature begins its turn in the prismatic

aura's area, it must make the appropriate saving throw (DC 26)

against that effect. Once activated, a humbaba's prismatic aura

lasts for 7 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Humbabas are 


	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid


	s of tremendous size

and power that prowl the forgotten places of the world.

Although a humbaba has the body of a powerful, muscular

human, its face is a twisted mockery that seems more leonine

than human. They often braid portions of their manes or

otherwise decorate them with skulls and weapons, and

prefer to wear half-plate armor and fight with longswords.

The first humbabas were once the favored minions

of the demon lord Pazuzu. In those days, humbabas had

magnificent birdlike wings. But when the mightiest of

the humbabas dared to attack Pazuzu in an ill-conceived

attempt to claim the demon lord's throne, Pazuzu

punished the entire humbaba race by stripping

them of their wings and casting them into

the Material Plane. There they now dwell,

forever denied the skies and cursed to live

lonely lives, incapable of forming even

the barest of friendships or alliances

with others of their kind.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Bewitching Brume (Su) Any creature within 10 feet of a hungry

fog or currently being affected by its enveloping mists must

succeed on a DC 8 Will save at the start of that creature's

turn or become shaken for 1 round at the half-glimpsed

shapes of phantoms floating within the fog. This is a mindaffecting

fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Enveloping Mists (Ex) A hungry fog can engulf foes (see

Universal Monster Rules in the Appendices). A creature

engulfed by a hungry fog does not gain the pinned condition

and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger

of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is

staggered in addition to the damage the attack causes. The

save DC to avoid the enveloping mists is Constitution-based.

Gaseous (Ex) A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie

mist. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings,

even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or other liquid.

It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects

as a result.

Vulnerable to Wind (Ex) A hungry fog is treated as a Tiny

creature for the purposes of determining the effects high

wind has upon it (see page 439 of the Core Rulebook).

This eerie, vaporous ooze slips silently through the air,

a roiling cloud of green fog within which dance the

indistinct shapes of twisted, spooky ghosts.

Despite its haunting appearance, and

despite the fact that hungry fogs

often dwell in old graveyards or

hunt battlefields, a hungry fog is

not an undead creature. Rather,

it is a form of gaseous ooze

infused with negative energy.

Thus, while a hungry

fog is not an undead

creature, undead gain

considerable boons

by fighting within

a hungry fog,

for its mists

heal them as

surely as they

drain vitality from

the living creatures

caught within.

Within a hungry

fog, the ooze's mists interact

strangely with fragments of those

it has consumed, creating eerie phantasms of its past

victims. Periodically, one of these shapes might f lash

with light as if momentarily holding a lantern aloft, but

as soon as the figure is approached, it fades away into the

surrounding mists, often giving the observer a quick and

unsettling glimpse of a skull-like countenance. These

shapes, like the fog itself, are not truly undead, but the

fact that a hungry fog is hurt by positive energy as surely

as if it were helps to blur the distinction and spread even

more confusion about its actual nature.

A hungry fog is instinctively drawn to areas where

negative energy is strong. These nocturnal creatures

are particularly fond of sites that are haunted, such as

old houses, abandoned graveyards, or shipwrecks along

shorelines-although their vulnerability to high winds

means that they are rarely encountered in areas where

storms are common.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Disease (Su) An iku-turso's bite inflicts

a strange, supernatural disease called

tursas. This disease causes the victim's

skin to grow painfully scaly, causes

strange hallucinations, and eventually

transforms the victim into an iku-turso.

Tursas: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 20;

onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect

1d3 Wis damage and 1d6 Cha drain;

cure 2 consecutive saves. As long as

a victim suffers any ability damage

from tursas, it gains the ability to

breathe water. A creature reduced to

0 Charisma by this disease transforms

into a fully grown and healthy ikuturso-

it immediately forgets its

previous life and abilities and seeks

out the nearest iku-turso community to

join it. A wish or miracle can reverse

this transformation. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Light Lure (Su) As a standard action, an iku-turso can call

forth a few small points of light, functioning like a dancing

lights spell (CL equals the iku-turso's HD) except as

described here. Creatures within 100 feet of one of these

lights must make a DC 18 Will save upon sighting them

or be compelled to approach them by the safest and most

direct path. A creature that successfully saves is immune

to the same iku-turso's light lure for 24 hours. If a subject

of this effect has to move through hazardous terrain to

reach the lights, that subject receives another saving

throw to end the effect before entering the hazardous

terrain. This effect ends once the character reaches the

light or takes any form of damage. This is a visual mindaffecting

charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Iku-tursos are hideous denizens of the deep sea. There,

they venerate sinister gods of plague and contagion and

torment victims plucked from ship and shore in special

air-filled torture chambers. Disease is sacred to the ikutursos,

and those who suffer from sickness are considered

blessed-an iku-turso often chooses to leave obviously

diseased victims to their fates rather than attempt to

capture them.

Change Shape (Su) A jackalwere has three forms. Its natural

form is that of a jackal, but it can also take the form of a

human or a human-jackal hybrid. A jackalwere's human

form is fixed-it cannot assume different human forms.

A jackalwere can use its sleep gaze in any of its forms.

In jackal form, it functions as a dog (Bestiary 87).

In its hybrid form, a jackalwere can make

a bite attack as a secondary attack, while

in human form it lacks its bite attack

entirely. A jackalwere can shift into any of

its three alternate forms as a move action.

Equipment does not meld with the new

form between human and hybrid forms

but does between those forms and its

jackal form.

Jackal Empathy (Ex) A jackalwere can communicate and

empathize with jackals (use stats for


	SIZE:S


	dog; see Bestiary

87), and can use Bluff as if it were Diplomacy to change a

jackal's attitude, receiving a +4 racial bonus to do so.

Sleep Gaze (Su) Sleep for 3 minutes (a standard action rouses

the creature, as does damage), 30 feet, Will DC 12 negates.

A creature that succeeds at the saving throw cannot be

affected by the same jackalwere's sleep gaze for 24 hours.

This is a sleep effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Weapon Intuition (Ex) A jackalwere is proficient with simple

and martial melee weapons.

Jackalweres are evil, supernatural jackals born with the

ability to assume human form. Some folks superstitiously

consider jackalweres to be emissaries of evil spirits or

wicked desert gods, and it is easy to understand why, as

they can take the shape of a human and possess a keen

intellect; however, they also have a taste for murder and

humanoid f lesh.

In its hybrid form, a

jackalwere stands 6 feet tall

and weighs 150 pounds.

retract as a free action. When a jorogumo's spider legs

are present, she gains a +8 circumstance bonus on Climb

checks and gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat.

Swift Shapechanger (Ex) A jorogumo can assume spider or

human form as a swift action.

Jorogumos are seductive schemers who secret themselves

away in isolated mountain valleys where they lure

travelers, especially men, to their dooms. Exclusively

female, jorogumos must mate with humanoids to produce

fertile eggs. After copulation, a jorogumo paralyzes her

partner by poisoning him into a coma. She lays a single egg

within the father's body, then cocoons the corpse and hides

the victim. Periodic visits to re-poison the victim ensure

his coma lasts for the 2d4 days required for the young

jorogumo to hatch and feed. Jorogumos are enthusiastic

enemies of tengus and attack them on sight-they never

take tengus as "mates."

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Adaptive Defense (Su) When first encountered,

a jubjub bird has no energy resistance. When

damaged by an attack that causes cold,

electricity, fire, or sonic damage, it gains

resistance 30 to that energy type until the

end of its next turn. If an attack causes more

than one type of energy damage, the jubjub

bird gains resistance 30 to all the types of energy

damage dealt.

Deadly Bite (Ex) A jubjub bird applies 1-1/2 times its

Strength modifier to damage dealt by its bite attack. A

successful critical hit decapitates and instantly slays a Large

or smaller victim (DC 33 Fortitude negates decapitation;

creatures without a head are immune to this effect) and deals

triple normal damage regardless of the decapitation result.

The save DC is Strength-based.

Planar Acclimation (Ex) A jubjub bird is always considered to

be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself

upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.

Shriek (Ex) Once every 1d6 rounds as a standard action, a jubjub

bird can voice a piercing screech. All creatures (other than

jubjub birds) within a 60-foot-radius spread must succeed at

a DC 26 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This is

a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The jubjub bird is a rare and dangerous bird that resembles

a giant dodo bird, but with long, muscular legs and wings

that provide functional, if awkward, f light. When attacked

with magic, a jubjub bird's plumage shifts randomly in

hue and pattern with each spell hurled against it.

Like the bandersnatch and other legendary creatures

such as the jabberwock, the jubjub bird originally hails

from the primal world of the fey. It has the dubious honor

of being the least powerful and least intelligent of these

creatures, which are known collectively as the "Tane,"

yet one should never assume that the jubjub bird is a

pushover-its penchant for snapping off heads with its

razor-sharp beak can quickly put such ideas to rest.

Powerful fey sometimes keep jubjub birds as guardians,

and there are even reports of giants (particularly powerful

tribes of jungle giants) using them as mounts. Such avian

allies must be carefully trained, for few giants and fey are

able to comfortably exist alongside a creature so prone to

uttering such stunning shrieks so often.

Jubjub birds stand about 20 feet tall and weigh

roughly 6,000 pounds.

Breath Weapon (Su) A kamadan can exhale a

cone of gas that makes living creatures fall

asleep for 5 minutes (Fortitude DC 15 negates).

Slapping or wounding awakens a creature put

to sleep by this attack, but normal noise does not.

This is a sleep effect. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Snakes (Ex) A kamadan's

snakes attack

simultaneously;

this is always a

secondary attack.

Kamadans are wicked

hunters that enjoy stalking

and toying with prey, especially when their

quarry is relatively intelligent. When a

kamadan attacks, it first uses its soporific

breath, then pounces on any targets that remain

awake. Kamadans stand about 3 feet at the shoulder,

about 9 feet long and weighing up to 500 pounds.

Although kamadans are certainly magical creatures,

they share many psychological and sociological traits

with other big cats. Even when hunting alone to avoid

competition, a kamadan is often a member of a larger

pride. In areas where wildlife or natives are more powerful,

kamadan packs are more likely to hunt as a unit.

Kamadans prefer underground lairs, but settle for rocky

outcroppings or dens inside brambles or other thick bushes,

and they use their snakes to manipulate the bones and baubles

of their prey into decorative arrangements. Occasionally, a

kamadan shares its lair with another creature, but only if

the other creature is more powerful or plies the kamadan

regularly with tributes of food and treasure.

Polar Kamadan (CR +2): A polar kamadan has white

fur with black spots like a snow leopard. Its snakes are

furred as well. A polar kamadan has the advanced creature

template and batlike wings that grant it a f ly speed of

60 ft. (average). The breath weapon of a polar kamadan

is particularly cold-those who succumb to it also suffer

1d4 points of Dexterity damage from numbness.

Kami

Kami are ancient, mystical, and otherworldly spirits

created eons ago by the gods. Originally intended as

guardians of those parts of nature that could not protect

themselves, kami have proven remarkably adaptive. As

the nature of reality changes, so do the kami.

There are countless species of kami-in theory, every

type of animal, plant, object, and location could be served

by its own type of kami. These are collectively called

"wards" by kami, who often think of them similar to

how a human might think of a young child placed into

his or her care. In practice, there are far more wards in

creation than there are kami. As such, all kami seek to

reproduce and thus expand their inf luence-the more

kami, the more wards what benefit from their protection.

Accordingly, kami inf luence is usually regional in

nature-the kami simply aren't numerous enough yet to

protect all of creation.

Further complicating attempts to catalog and

categorize kami is the fact that there seems to be no

rhyme or reason as to what sorts of wards get specific

types of kami. The jinushigami, for example, are a

race of kami that associate with all manner of regions,

while the kodama concern themselves narrowly with

the protection of specific trees. To the kami, these

apparently arbitrary classifications make perfect sense,

and their attempts to explain the reasoning to others

generally result in confused listeners and frustrated

kami. One thing that does remain constant, though, is

the relationship between a kami's size and the import of

its ward. A kami associated with a knife, frog, or single

pebble in a stream would generally be quite small and

unimposing, while a kami associated with a mountain,

redwood tree, or elephant would be proportionally larger

and more powerful. Of course, even here there seem to

be exceptions, and frustrated scholars often wonder only

half-jokingly whether the gods themselves vary these

rules only to cause scholastic arguments and frustration.

Kami come into existence either as a spontaneously

manifesting spirit or as the reincarnation of a

particularly noble soul. Souls of creatures who died to

protect an element of nature are particularly prone to

returning to life as a kami. In this latter way, many kami

arise from the souls of dedicated rangers or druids who

perished while defending their homelands, or monks

who spent a lifetime meditating on the serenity of nature.

Once reincarnated, however, few kami remember any of

their former lives, and their forms never resemble their

former bodies. The rare kami who do recall their prior

lives are the kami most likely to become more than mere

guardians-these kami often take class levels and grow

quite powerful.

Kami exist as ever-morphing spirits rather than souls

trapped in concrete forms. Most exist to watch over

a single tree, stone, or bend of a stream, and can have

no more inf luence on the world than a single insect. A

kami spends the majority of its existence merged with its

ward-in this shape, it has no ability to interact with the

world at all, but it can observe its surroundings with ease.

There is no reliable way to determine whether an object,

plant, animal, or location is protected by a kami, so those

who travel or live in regions where kami are common

generally assume that everything has a kami guardian.

The kami do little to dissuade this, since the belief that

kami are present is often just as potent a protection as

having a kami in the first place.

All kami can assume physical form. Most somewhat

resemble their ward, but again, in apparent eagerness to

baff le and frustrate scholars, this is not always the case.

When a kami assumes physical form, it always initially

appears adjacent to its ward, manifesting suddenly as

if teleporting. It is considered impolite by kami to pop

into view, though-most prefer to manifest bodies while

hiding, such as behind a tree, then step out of hiding to

reveal themselves to those they wish to speak to.

Kami are generally a peaceable race, cohabitating

with friendly fey and other magical beings that reside

in natural environments. Dryads and treants alike find

the company of kami to be quite favorable, as these

noble spirits are willing to defend their lands to the

death. Being more destructive, troublesome fey find

themselves unwelcome in lands overseen by kami, who

use the power of nature itself to obliterate intruders who

make a nuisance of themselves. Kami's peaceful nature

never vanishes more quickly than when they face oni,

however, for no other creature is as hated by the kami as

these. Kami view oni as defilers of the natural world and

monsters whose goals and actions are in direct conf lict

with those of the nature spirits. When oni are spotted

in areas guarded by kami, all kami alert each other to

this intrusion, and band together to root out the dark

presence. The fact that when a kami falls from grace it

runs the risk of becoming an oni has much to do with

this hatred-essentially, kami see oni as physical proof

of their race's capacity for failure and shame.

While kami are rarely evil, they place the protection of

their wards above all else. Often, this puts them at odds

with other creatures, and as a result, many tend to view

kami as troublemakers at best and outright monsters at

worst. The kami have little care for how they are viewed

by non-kami, of course-what matters to them is the

safety of their wards.

The most powerful kami are known as kami lords.

These mysterious and unique creatures are fantastically

powerful, often on par with demigods or greater entities.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Infused Quarterstaff (Su) Any quarterstaff a jinushigami wields

functions as a +5 quarterstaff (unless the quarterstaff already

has a greater enhancement bonus). If a jinushigami is within

its regional ward, it can create a


	SIZE:G


	quarterstaff out

of the surrounding terrain as a standard action.

Manipulate Terrain (Su) A jinushigami can help any number of

creatures travel within its territory. Creatures aided in this

way receive a +10 bonus on Survival checks and do not suffer

reductions to overland movement from terrain or lack of a

highway or other roadway, regardless of the presence of roads

or the type of terrain they actually travel through. Alternatively,

a jinushigami can make terrain more difficult for any number

of creatures to travel through, imparting a -10 penalty on all

Survival checks and causing overland movement to be reduced

to one-tenth its normal speed. A jinushigami can affect as

many creatures as it wishes with this ability, selecting whether

it aids or impedes travel for each, as long as it can notice

the creature and the creature is within its regional ward. A

jinushigami may use this ability while merged with its ward.

Ward (Su) A jinushigami treats an entire region as its ward.

This region can be a single forest, swamp, mountain, lake,

or any other natural feature, with a maximum radius of

5 miles. Most jinushigami have smaller regional wards,

since not all regions are large enough to fill this area, but

no region with a radius smaller than 1 mile radius can

support (or deserves) a jinushigami. As long as it is within

its territory (either merged with it or in its physical form), a

jinushigami can observe the world from any point within its

regional ward as if it were at that point. While merged with

its ward, it can observe all points simultaneously in this

way. As a standard action, it can convey information about a

creature within its ward (effectively imparting a description

and exact location) to all kami within its regional ward.

Guardians of significant natural wonders like mountains,

large lakes, forests, and so on, jinushigami (known also as

land kami) are the most powerful and revered of all kami,

commanding the very forces of nature itself to ensure the

safety and security of their wards. These potent spirits

garner the most respect among other kami, wielding great

inf luence over both them and the native creatures that dwell

within their territories. Jinushigami tend to stay hidden

amongst their land, however, knowing that their intimate

tie with the environment makes them highly desirable

targets among those who would seek to do harm to nature.

Strangers to lands protected by jinushigami are welladvised

to take the utmost care to not offend the powerful

spirit creatures. When displeased, jinushigami can eradicate

trails and warp the contours of their terrain, forcing

travelers to endure unreasonable hardship in travel. These

goliaths have little patience for those who would defile their

efforts, and offenders who fail to listen to a jinushigami's

initial hints quickly discover how devastating the kami's

powers can be as they are forced from the land either by

160

the lesser kami who serve their superior or by the towering

jinushigami itself. Of course, those who respect and honor

the jinushigami see the kami's other side, as the kami eases

their travel by lessening undergrowth, shifting rivers, and

otherwise providing subtle but incredible aid to travelers.

Jinushigami are ancient and wise, and while they are

no fools, they prefer to give visitors to their domains the

benefit of the doubt. Only when an individual makes

known his disruptive intentions toward the structure and

cohesion of nature does a jinushigami react with violence.

Of course, those who align themselves with naturally

opposing forces of the kami, such as the oni, do not receive

this friendly grace period, and a jinushigami can perceive

most treacherous thoughts, sensing a suspicious visitor

through its connection with the land, then tracking it

down to stealthily observe it more closely.

A jinushigami is 38 feet tall and weighs over 30,000

pounds. When they manifest physical bodies, they appear

as lumbering humanoid forms made of earth and stone

and plant matter, sometimes with strange humanoid

affectations like hats or jewelry.

ELDER JINUSHIGAMI

Of all the kami, land kami are the most ancient and

powerful, yet even among these immense outsiders there

are variations in that power. Newly formed jinushigami

grows more powerful as the legend and fame of the

site it guards grows. For example, a jinushigami

of part of a mountain range is impressive, but a

jinushigami whose region includes the range's

tallest mountain is even more so.

When a jinushigami becomes this

powerful, it is known as an elder

jinushigami. An elder jinushigami

is generally a

and rarely has fewer than 28 Hit

Dice-most are between

CR 25, although exact details vary.

An elder jinushigami's ward can cover

a much larger area than that of a typical

jinushigami, usually with a radius of 1 mile

per


	CR:possessed by the elder jinushigami. An

elder jinushigami also gains additional spelllike

abilities to more closely ref lect its role in the

world. Listed below are several examples.

Glacier Kami: An elder jinushigami associated with

a vast glacier, be it one that carves mountains or runs

along a polar coastline, appears as a humanoid made of

blocks of ice. These kami have the cold subtype instead

of the earth subtype (and thus gain immunity to cold and

vulnerability to fire), and can use cone of cold and wall of ice

as spell-like abilities three times per day each.

Great Reef Kami: An elder jinushigami whose domain

contains a sizable coral reef of considerable age appears

as a humanoid constructed of living coral draped with

seaweed. Great reef kami have the water subtype instead

of the earth subtype, gain the aquatic subtype (and the

amphibious special quality), gain a swim speed of 60 ft.,

and gain the ability to use tsunami (Advanced Player's Guide

251) once per day as a spell-like ability.

Mountain Kami: When an elder jinushigami's ward

includes the tallest peak in a range or region, it gains the

use of f lesh to stone and wall of stone three times per day each.

Volcano Kami: An elder jinushigami that includes in

its ward an active volcano appears as a humanoid made of

equal parts molten rock and solid stone. A volcano kami

has the fire subtype instead of the earth subtype (and

thus gains immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold),

can use fireball three times per day as a spell-like ability,

and can use wall of lava (Advanced Player's Guide 255) once

per day as a spell-like ability.

Revered by druids and rangers for their

attunement with the wilds, kodama,

known also as tree kami, are the

guardians of the wild trees of

the forest-they do not

protect trees cultivated and grown in civilized areas.

(Those trees are protected by different kami, if at all.) A

kodama takes a single tree under its protection; typically,

all of the trees in a forest that are protected by kodama

are clustered together in one particular area.

A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely

humanoid creature with only the vaguest of features

on its semispherical head. A tree kami is 3 feet tall and

weighs 60 pounds. While one might expect the kami of

something as large as a tree to itself be larger, the fact that

forests are made up of so many trees tends to diminish the

singular "presence" any single tree might have. In cases

where a tree is particularly ancient or immense, however,

the kodama associated with it is much larger-STATISTICS

for such rare kodama can be generated by advancing the

kodama given here by several Hit Dice and increasing its

size-theoretically, a


	SIZE:C


	kodama with more than

20 Hit Dice could exist somewhere in the world. Not all

kodama increase in power by gaining racial Hit Dice,

though, as some instead progress by gaining class levels,

particularly levels of druid, though a rare few kodama

kami-those possessed of minds more ordered and

structured than is normal for their race-take the path

of the monk.

Kodama are more curious about visitors than most

kami, and often manifest their physical bodies

simply to watch and observe newcomers to

their groves. A kodama usually manifests

on the far side of its tree, or in the shadows

of the undergrowth, so that it can slowly

step out into visibility to quietly observe with

its distracting, empty-eyed gaze. This gaze can

be particularly unnerving. Those who have

fallen under its supernatural effects often

have different descriptions of how the gaze

made them feel (ashamed, frightened,

curious, amused, and nervous being the

most common reactions), yet the end

result is essentially the same. While

under observation by a curious

kodama, few are those who can

continue their actions without

being at least somewhat distracted

by the kami's attention.

When a kodama must fight (typically

in order to defend its tree or other kami),

it moves quickly-kodama work best in

groups, and when confronted alone

generally use tree stride to travel to

another part of the forest to raise

a small host of allies to aid it in

defending its home.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Improvised Weapon Mastery (Ex) A

shikigami gains Catch Off-Guard and

Throw Anything as bonus feats, and

adds its Charisma modifier instead

of its Strength modifier to damage

done with any improvised weapon,

as attacks it makes with such

weapons seem supernaturally

lucky in landing damaging

blows. Although a shikigami

is Tiny, it never provokes attacks of opportunity when

it attacks an adjacent foe with a melee weapon. If a

shikigami critically hits an opponent with an improvised

weapon, it deals ?3 damage.

Shikigami are the least of the kami, yet they make up for

their lowly status with their loyalty and bravery. Unlike

most other well-known types of kami, shikigami are

more often associated with rural and urban regions than

with natural settings. These kami are the protectors of

the minor works of civilization-things like milestones,

waymarkers, tiny garden statues, and other relatively

mundane works of art crafted by humanoid hands.

No two shikigami look exactly alike, as bef its a race

of kami that associates with such a wide range of wards.

While all shikigami have the ability to merge with their

wards, these kami are also fond of spending time in

their physical forms, watching over their wards either

invisibly or in the form of a tiny statue. In combat, a

shikigami f ights with whatever objects it f inds at hand.

Although relatively weak, these improvised weapons

have an uncanny knack for hitting harder than

they should.

Shikigami are as friendly and curious as other

kami, but they are quick to leave an area they

see as being polluted by ideals that disrupt

the virtues of nature. When they do, they

generally take their wards with them. They

do not engage humanoids who desecrate

the environment, but their absence

leaves a profound mark on the morale

of perceptive villagers. Should the

shikigami leave, town officials who

know the function of the miniature

kami are quick to change policies in

their community to ref lect a more

naturalistic approach, hoping

to rekindle the relationship

between shikigami and people,

lest the community fall into the

disfavor of more powerful and

less passive kami.

Shikigami typically stand 2 feet tall

and weigh 30 pounds, or 50 pounds

when taking their statue forms. A

spellcaster must have the Improved

Familiar feat, an alignment of lawful

neutral, and an arcane caster level of

7th or higher to gain a shikigami

familiar. Whenever a shikigami

becomes a familiar,

it treats its master

as its ward.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Touch of Ages (Su) When a toshigami hits a target with a touch

attack or any melee weapon, the target must succeed at a

DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically aged. When a

toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to

physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the

target's age. If it increases the target's physical age, the target

takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If

it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes 1 point

of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with

the toshigami's numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a

target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against

the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for

1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually

alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping

effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly

infantile state of mind. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Toshigami, known also as blossom kami, are associated

with cherry trees-particularly those that grow in inhabited

areas. Often, long after a city has fallen to ruin, these kami

guardians are all that remain to remember the lost city's

glory. In this way, the toshigami are also associated with the

passing of time.

Toshigami rarely show themselves except to those

in dire need or who are harming their trees. Still, they

have a fascination with mortals, and have even been

known to form romantic

relationships with them on

occasion. A toshigami is 5 feet

tall and weighs 100 pounds.

infuse an arrow it fires to carry any of the following

use of the same spell-like ability. The zuishin must

make a touch attack to deliver the effect to the

target-the target takes no damage from the arrow.

Holy Weapons (Su) Any weapon wielded by a zuishin

is treated as if it had the holy special ability.

A zuishin creates arrows out of nothing as part of its attacks

with any bow it wields.

While all kami are enemies of oni, none are so fervent as the

zuishin. Known also as shrine kami, zuishin take as their

wards gates, doorways, religious places, and the spiritual

archways known as torii, ensuring that the gates are

respected. Zuishin can use many weapons, but tend to favor

the bow. A zuishin treats its equipment with utmost care,

viewing weapons as extensions of itself. It never discards its

bow voluntarily; if the weapon is ever lost or destroyed, a

zuishin can craft a new one in a month.

Zuishin treat other kami with respect, and are always

willing to lend a helping hand. Creatures other than kami

must earn a zuishin's trust before receiving its aid, and do

so by honoring the gate it guards or providing an offering to

the kami, such as a tree branch or other small piece of nature.

Zuishin manifest as suits of armor with a partly manifest

warrior within, and wield glowing weapons. They stand 5 feet

tall and weigh 120 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Head Bowl (Su) The basin atop a kappa's head contains

water from its home river or lake. The water is emptied

only if the kappa willingly tips its head or a creature

pinning the kappa forces it to do so (requiring a grapple

check while pinned). If the water is emptied, the kappa

becomes immobile and staggered. It can still take

actions, but it cannot move from the spot on its own.

If the emptied head bowl is refilled with water, the

kappa recovers from this condition immediately. This

replacement water doesn't have to be from the kappa's

home, but the kappa refills its head bowl from there at

its first opportunity.

A kappa is a strange amphibian resembling a humanoid

turtle. It dwells in fresh water, preferring a stream or river

to a lake or pond. It has a small shell on its back, a blunt

face, and webbed hands and feet that end in short claws. A

typical kappa is green in color, but kappa skin tones can

vary toward blue or yellow hues. The creature has a shallow

basin in the top of its head, in which the creature

carries water from its home at all times.

Kappas are puckish and like to play tricks on those

who pass near or swim in their home. Kappa pranks are

usually harmless and annoying, such as peeking under

robes, stealing a bathers' clothing, or pretending to be an

aquatic predator. A kappa might also challenge others to

grappling matches, hoping potential foes underestimate

its wrestling ability. An angry kappa can be dangerous,

attempting to drown mounts, animal companions,

or even people who enter its home waters. The most

degenerate kappas have been known to drown bathers

and eat them.

Those wise to the ways of kappas know the creatures

have a few weaknesses. First of all, kappas love cucumbers

and horsef lesh. If plied with such treats, a kappa is likely

to not bother intruders, and might even be convinced to

offer aid. Further, despite a kappa's penchant for pranks,

it is unfailingly polite to courteous visitors. A kappa

confronted with a verbal rebuke rather than combat

quickly and almost shamefully apologizes for its pranks,

begging for forgiveness.

If its head bowl is emptied, a kappa usually remains

stationary and pleads for help, continuing to fight only if

forced to. An opponent who refills the kappa's head bowl

after spilling it receives the kappa's deepest gratitude.

Only the wisest and smartest of kappa carry f lasks of

water with them when they are forced to travel far from

their home-most kappa don't think this far ahead.

ECOLOGY

Environment warm forests

Organization solitary, pair, or

tribe (3-36 plus 2-6 dire apes)

Treasure standard (longbow with

20 arrows, other treasure)

Not quite man nor ape, the kech is a

hairless primate that dwells in the deepest

jungles. There they live in sizable tribes,

relying upon their uncanny coloration and

skill with bows to hunt prey. The green-andbrown

camouf lage coloration of a kech's f lesh

shifts and adapts to all surroundings to aid in

stealth, but works particularly well in forests or jungles.

This, combined with its uncanny ability to move through

any terrain and leave no trace of its passage, makes the

kech a masterful ambush hunter. A kech is 6 feet tall and

weighs 240 pounds.

These creatures prefer to dwell in ruined jungle

buildings, and when presented with an opportunity to

seize a remote town, slaughter the citizens, and move in,

the typical kech tribe does not hesitate. Keches are as cruel

as they are stealthy, and most jungle villages do not realize

that they are under attack by a band of keches until the

battle is already decided, with more than half the village

dead in their beds, never having had the chance to awake

and sound an alarm. Once a village does rouse to mount

a resistance, the keches often seek to subdue remaining

victims rather than kill them. Those who are slaughtered

are inevitably eaten within 24 hours as part of a tremendous

victory feast. Prisoners are often kept in cages in close

proximity to the feasting, for keches enjoy the sound of

wailing as their victims watch their kin being consumed.

A kech tribe is typically led by a chieftain with 2-4

levels of ranger or fighter. Keches value magical support,

particularly divine magic, for the jungle has no shortage

of methods to wound, poison, or sicken those who dwell

within. A kech cleric is as likely to worship an evil deity as

it is one of the Four Horsemen or an evil elemental lord,

but most kech priests are in fact druids. The combination

of restorative magic and power over the natural world is

often too seductive a path for a devout kech to ignore. Kech

druids typically take apes as animal companions, and even

tribes that lack druids generally have a few well-trained

guard apes among them.

Cannibalism is seen as a particularly vile taboo by

keches-this prohibition extends to the consumption of

ape or monkey f lesh, but notably does not extend to the

f lesh of humanoids.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Spells A kirin casts spells as a 6th-level sorcerer, and can cast

spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available

to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for

a kirin, meaning that the creature does not need a divine

focus to cast them.

The noble kirin roam the sky, their feet rarely touching

soil. They have a stag's graceful body and cloven hooves,

a pair of backward-facing horns, and a thick mane and

tail ranging from golden to brilliant reds or purples in

the hues of the setting sun. Their hide resembles that of a

dragon, the scales gleaming ebon or iridescent green.

Rare in the extreme, kirin seldom meddle openly in

worldly affairs, preferring a subtle hand in overturning

the schemes of wicked spirits such as hags and oni. The

blood of young kirin runs hot, however, and such spirited

youths may serve as mounts for cavaliers and paladins of

clever wit and untarnished moral quality.

The wisest and most powerful kirin are known as

emperor kirin, having earned this title through the

respect of their peers and the strength of their powers.

They resemble standard kirin, except their hooves give

off sparks as they gallop through the air.

Emperor kirin have the advanced creature simple

template and additional racial Hit Dice. When advancing

a kirin's Hit Dice to create an emperor kirin, make the

following additional changes.

. CR: Increase by 1 + the number of additional HD.

. Breath Weapon: Damage increases by 1d6 for every 2

. Spellcasting: Increase sorcerer level (for the purpose of

spells known and spells per day) by 1 per additional HD.

. Spell-Like Abilities: Increase caster level by +1 per

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Piercing Beak (Ex) A kongamato's beak

is extremely hard and adept at breaking

objects. When attempting to damage an item,

a kongamato's beak attack does double

damage and is treated as if it

were adamantine for the

purposes of overcoming the

object's hardness.

Wailing Dive (Su) When a

kongamato makes

a charge while

flying or uses its

Flyby Attack feat,

the creature's

body becomes

infused with

energy, causing its bite to deal an extra +1d6 points of sonic

damage on that attack.

Kongamatos are primeval dragons that hunt the deep

jungles of the world. Although not as intelligent or

magically adept as their "true" cousins, kongamatos are

respected and feared for their resilience and awesome

strength. While the kongamato's body is clearly draconic-

squat and dense with sharp claws capping each of its four

limbs-the creature's head is distinctly avian, with a long,

toothless beak and a pronounced crest. A kongamato's hide

is a rich emerald hue, with an ash-colored underbelly

and crimson webbing on its broad wings. Females have

smaller head-crests than males, and a rosy hue colors both

the undersides of their wings and their underbellies.

Kongamatos are apex predators that make their lairs in

the tops of the oldest and strongest trees, or in caves and

ruins. Kongamatos are carnivorous and prey on large herd

animals. Although they do not have teeth, their beaks are

sharp and strong, allowing them to carve their kills with

precision and to punch through wood, rock, and even metal.

When possible, kongamatos hunt on the perimeter of their

territories, gliding silently and gracefully through even the

thickest forest foliage to surprise prey.

Both males and females grow to a length of almost 30

feet, with an equally broad wingspan, and can weigh up to

7 tons. Kongamatos live between 500 and

600 years.

Kyton

Despicably cruel and equally horrible to gaze upon, kytons

are evil fiends who feed on the fear and suffering of mortals

through painful supernatural means. Their monstrous

appearances vary, but their stoic and amoral dispositions

are universal, for no kyton cares anything for the plights

typical of the creatures they prey upon. They are beings

wholly dedicated to metamorphosis achieved through

horrific trials of self-mutilation and the mystical power

provided them by their sapping of mortal anguish.

Despite being often categorized by mortals as shadowdwelling

devils, kytons calmly refute such claims, seeing

themselves as above the principles of Hell's denizens.

Instead, kytons seek ecstasy through pain in the form of

deliberate and violent self-transformation, adhering to

the belief that by altering the physical and spiritual matter

that makes up their form, they can reach a state of perfect

being. Removing aspects of themselves and replacing

them with more desirable or powerful pieces one at a time,

kytons believe that experiences of heightened emotion and

sensation (typically in the forms of terror and pain) lead to

greater states of awareness and existence. The dedication

with which they practice this belief places them on the level

of zealots, their fanatical commitment made all the more

disturbing by their eerie composedness and unnaturally

cool dispositions.

The original kytons were born of the first truly selfish

and depraved thoughts conceived by mortals. These

creatures surprised and horrified the early gods with their

power and hideous nature, and so the gods chained them

in a remote part of Hell. The kytons embraced their chains

and, seeking to fulfill their unnatural hunger for pain,

escaped to the Plane of Shadow, which lay much closer to

their mortal prey. Now, kytons are born of mortal souls that

were spiritually and physically tortured in life, victims of

their own masochism, sacrifices to gods of suffering, or

those promised to the fiends either by their own will or by

sadistic cultists. Obscure rituals force the sacrificed souls

to bypass the normal judgments of the afterlife and instead

become mired in the Plane of Shadow. Over an excruciating

and lengthy span of time, these souls are warped and

twisted until they emerge as frail new kytons. A kyton's

first willing act must be to cut away part of its own f lesh,

proving it is worthy of its kyton nature-the first step in an

immortal lifetime of replacing its own substance with the

stronger parts of other creatures. By drawing strength from

its new grafts, a kyton grows and becomes both stronger

and more terrible to behold. Thus, weaker kytons resemble

the mortal creatures they once were, whereas older ones are

horrifying patchworks of transplanted material that rarely

look like their original forms. Many kytons still proudly

wear the chains that bound them (either to Hell or to the

torture devices that created them), trophies of their power

to defy the gods or mortal fate.

Kytons' need to replace parts of themselves with those

of stronger mortals puts them in perpetual danger of

attacking creatures that are too powerful for them to kill.

For this reason, kytons are pragmatic and ruthless in their

battles, scrutinizing all potential outcomes of a situation

before taking action. Seeing strength in numbers, kytons

often attack or trap a mortal victim as a team, hauling the

unfortunate soul to the Plane of Shadow, converting their

prey into a new kyton or dividing its body and soul among

them for grafting and nourishment.

The kytons of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary are a specific

type of kyton (other kytons call them "evangelists"); they

have all the traits listed in the kyton subtype (see page 306).

The kytons listed here are but a few of the other known

types-many more exist on the Plane of Shadow.

Kyton Demagogues

The powerful kyton rulers called demagogues possess

strength hardly fathomable by mortals. They exist within

a power structure similar to that of archdevils. Lesser kytons

view these overseers as horrid sovereigns among their kind,

and though there are many outlying areas on the Plane of

Shadow not controlled by demagogues, kytons who find

themselves wandering through a demagogue's territory

know to show respect for these lords of suffering.

Demagogues are so advanced in their metamorphosis of selfmutilation

and augmentation that no two look alike. Some are

strangely beautiful, some are horrors beyond sane description.

A demagogue's powers are vaster than even many of their kyton

brethren dare consider-they construct enormous cities out of

the countless bodies of their victims, weaving entire networks

of veins and spiritual energy to create breathing, pulsating

metropolises. Demagogues seek to control as much of the

realm around their organic superstructures as they can, a feat

that proves forever challenging in the dark, shifting corners of

the Plane of Shadow. Though one rarely finds reason to leave

the confines of its home plane, a demagogue's influence is

far-reaching, and kytons who value their lives do as they are

commanded, lest they incite the awful and calculating rage of a

mighty overlord. The following are some of the most powerful

kyton demagogues that reside in the Plane of Shadow, watching

over their pulsating kingdoms in massive, gory towers.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an augur's

unnerving gaze becomes shaken for 1 round.

Gory sentinels with a lust for f lesh and the myriad bodily

f luids contained within, augurs number among the

most common-as well as most despicable-kytons on

the Plane of Shadow. Having given up their humanoid

bodies in favor of the more stealthy and wretched guise

of a singular large eye armored in bloodied metal

plates, augurs act as spies and sycophants for more

powerful kytons. Their miniscule size, sturdy exterior,

and unnerving gazes make them ideally equipped for

dangerous reconnaissance missions to the Material

Plane, where the augurs are able to scout out potential

raiding locations or spot vulnerable, lone travelers before

their more powerful kyton brethren cross the

planes to attack.

While their usefulness in tasks of stealth and guile

makes augurs deadly companions, their insatiable lust

for blood often proves their ultimate downfall. Augurs,

like most kytons, find themselves in a heightened state of

arousal when witness to the destruction of f lesh, but the

extent to which these muscular orbs find pleasure in blood

is far more treacherous than their more disciplined peers.

Many augurs cannot help but indulge themselves when

exposed to gore-rolling within and dipping their blades

into freshly spilled pools-an unfortunate trait which has

led many careless augurs to their capture or doom.

An augur's gruesome appearance is not always selfinf

licted. They are sometimes constructed by other

kytons who seek to impose an everlasting punishment

upon a particularly unwilling mortal sacrifice; the

defiant individual's body is cast aside for scraps as its

mind and soul are transferred into the monocular shell,

producing an augur when the ritual is complete. Augurs

are the least pragmatic type of all kytons, and thus the

least respected among their peers. The condemnation

of an individual's spirit to the cage-like body of a kyton

augur is the precedent for a truly agonizing and lonely

existence.

A lawful evil spellcaster can gain an augur as a familiar

at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.

A typical augur kyton is 1 foot in diameter and weighs

30 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Immune to Pain (Su) An eremite is immune to nonlethal

damage, as well as to all magical effects associated with

extreme pain, such as a symbol of pain, another eremite's pain

attack, or similar effects at the GM's discretion.

Evisceration (Ex) When an eremite grapples a foe, it can

quickly eviscerate or otherwise surgically alter its victim

by excising a bit of flesh or a part of an internal organ as

a swift action, causing the victim to take 1d8 points of

ability drain-the exact ability score drained is chosen by

the eremite. The victim can resist this effect with a DC 28

Fortitude save. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Graft Flesh (Su) Once per day, an eremite may graft any bit

of flesh or bone harvested via its evisceration ability within

the previous hour to its own body as a full-round action

that provokes an attack of opportunity. Doing so grants the

eremite the effects of a heal and a greater restoration spell

(caster level 20th).

Pain (Su) Any creature struck by an eremite's natural attacks

must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or become staggered for

1 round from the pain. As long as a creature is staggered by

this effect, it takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made

to resist the eremite's spell-like and extraordinary abilities.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Shadow Traveler (Ex) When an eremite uses plane shift to

travel to the Plane of Shadow, it arrives at its intended

destination with complete accuracy. When an eremite uses

shadow walk, it moves at a rate of 100 miles per hour.

Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an

eremite's unnerving gaze becomes paralyzed with fear

for 1d4 rounds as it finds itself almost longing to submit

its flesh to the kyton. At the end of any round it remains

paralyzed in this way, the victim must make a DC 31 Will

save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain from encroaching

madness. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Eremites are among the eldest and most mutilated

of kytons, having inf licted such massive damage to

themselves that they feel little pain and no fear. The

typical eremite is completely covered in blood-caked

bandages, tattered cords of black leather, and thousands

of jagged shards of razor-sharp metal. These fragments

are all that holds the creature's mutilated f lesh together,

yet they do so with a strength far greater than that

granted by mortal f lesh and bone.

Rather than concentrating solely on physical or even

spiritual alterations, eremites seek to blur the very lines

around being, physicality, and individuality. They desire

only the most powerful beings to augment themselves

with, traveling across vast swaths of the Material Plane

in search of the most promising additions to their bodily

collection and harvesting only the finest parts-the

ripest spleen, the most alluring veins, the most succulent

eyes. When an eremite encounters a creature that

possess a so-called "perfect part," the powerful kyton

seeks to capture that creature alive so that it can study

how that perfect part functions as part of the creature's

physiology before it finally decides to surgically remove

172

Illustration by Ryan Portillo

it and attach it to its own body-often in a way not quite

in keeping with the part's original use. A gifted bard's

tongue might, for example, be nailed to a kyton's palm

or sewn into its heart, while the eyes of a beautiful queen

might be stitched into the kyton's torso. To the eremite,

these hideous changes and choices somehow enhance

the perfection of the harvested part, while to others they

merely enhance the horror that the creature represents.

While eremites do hold an appreciation for inspection

of their targets as well as introspection regarding their

own powers and identity, their primary occupation is

the understanding of pain and suffering, which they

pursue by inf licting the most heinous cruelties upon

their victims. An eremite seeks to deliver as much agony

as possible to its victims after capturing them, allowing

them to undergo extreme amounts of trauma before

letting them perish. An eremite often rends its own

f lesh in the same manner as it does its victim's, so as to

experience the pain alongside it.

While pursuing a chosen victim, an eremite utilizes

its supernatural abilities to distract and distress a given

target before it captures and drags it back to the Plane of

Shadow via plane shift. Bargaining with an eremite is not

usually an option, though if a particularly powerful victim

can offer an eremite advice or aid, or otherwise assist

in harvesting an even more interesting catch,

an eremite can sometimes be convinced

to let the helpful victim escape. It's

worth remembering, though, that

kytons as a whole have little patience

for the petty pursuits of honor and

pride, seeing such feelings as traits

that ultimately spell the end for

baser creatures. The only thing

that matters to an eremite is the

testing of its boundaries as well

as the boundaries of existence

itself. Just because an eremite

might be convinced to let

someone go in trade for an

opportunity for a greater

catch doesn't mean that once

that other target is secured the eremite will

cease its attempts to capture and harvest its original

target. One who manages to distract and subsequently

escape an eremite is well-advised to spend the rest of his

life on the run.

A typical eremite stands approximately 7 feet tall and

weighs about 200 pounds. While their general form is

something of a humanoid shape, exact appearances can

vary wildly between eremites as they harvest and graft

particularly unusual pieces of f lesh to their bodies from

increasingly exotic victims.

EREMITE OVERLORDS

Eremites who surpass the limits of individuality and achieve

dominion over a certain realm of the Plane of Shadow are

referred to as eremite overlords. An overlord has focused

on a specific type of mutilation, and has taken that heinous

surgical procedure to the outer limits of pain and pleasure.

Those who worship and venerate the overlords often seek

to emulate their patron's chosen mutilation, often fatally

so. Overlords keep in correspondence with one another and

sometimes collaborate in a Covenant of Overlords, and while

they do not view each other as enemies, they are by no means

allies, and often vie for the favor of the demagogues.

Each overlord is a unique


	SIZE:L


	(or larger) eremite with

several additional Hit Dice. In addition, each has a unique

power linked to its chosen form of self-mutilation, as well

as 4-6 additional spell-like abilities along that mutilation's

theme. For example, an overlord that has perfected the act

of skinning itself and wrapping its f lesh in thorny black

vines might have an ability to send those thorny vines out at

great length to grapple and constrict distant foes, and

might gain black tentacles, entangle, wall of thorns,

and 1-3 similar spell-like abilities.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Surgical Strikes (Ex) An interlocutor's claws

threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. On

a successful critical hit, that claw deals 2d6

bleed damage rather than 1d6.

Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs

to an eremite's unnerving gaze becomes staggered for 1

round as it becomes convinced that it recognizes some of its

own body parts entangled in the interlocutor's body.

Interlocutors are the self-proclaimed surgeon-sculptors

among kytons, viewing their practice as more art than

medical process. Each victim is a new chance to study

the art of pain and sensation through horror-stricken

eyes. Their ability to heal the damage they inf lict, even

to the extent of restoring life to a subject that has only

just expired, is perhaps more feared than their eagerness

to cut f lesh. To an interlocutor's victim, death is a mercy

that is rarely offered.

Nowhere is the interlocutor's mastery of f lesh more

apparent than in their bodies, for their apotheosis from

mortal into kyton involves the shedding of useless parts

down to a tangle of nerves, veins, and various organs.

These are then incorporated into bodies made of semiliving

metal fashioned from raw shadowstuff harvested

in strange reaches of the Plane of Shadow, giving the kyton

a terrifying body. Periodically, an arm or other "leftover"

limb is retained by the kyton, but only in the same way

someone might retain ownership of a treasured piece of

jewelry as a keepsake or memento. Some interlocutors

retain nothing of their old bodies of f lesh save the brain,

nerves, and portions of their circulatory system.

Interlocutors are 9 feet tall and weigh 800 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Spells A lammasu casts spells as a 7th-level oracle

(Advanced Player's Guide 44), but does not gain any other

class abilities possessed by an oracle. It ignores all divine

focus material components for spells it casts.

Lammasus are protectors of the weak and ever-vigilant

champions against evil. These noble creatures dwell in

crumbling desert ruins or other remote areas, where they

tirelessly fight against the forces of darkness, hoping to

defend those they consider lesser races from the evils that

often lurk in such places.

Although most of these winged sentinels prove wise

and knowledgeable about those who would seek to do

evil in their lands, many races find lammasus arrogant,

dismissive, and patronizing, taking umbrage at their

superior attitudes and affectations. Such reactions confuse

and sometimes insult these highly honorable creatures,

who seek only to do good and aid those weaker than

themselves. Lammasus who witness members of other

races actively combating evil typically prove more sensitive

and address such allies as equals. Should good-aligned

creatures prove their skill and overcome any differences of

attitude they might have with one of these majestic beings,

they find a true and noble ally and an invaluable resource

for those hoping to defeat evil.

Lammasus are quite parental toward those who join

their cause, bringing a lifetime of experience to any

struggle. This often makes them stern, but those who

know lammasus find them to be extremely caring about

those they protect. A lammasu eagerly lays down its own

life to protect those in peril if such a sacrifice might win

the day. Most lammasus are 8 feet in length and

weigh approximately 900 pounds.

Leshy

Originally grown as servants for more powerful fey and

intelligent plant life such as elder treants, leshys are

sentient plants who look after their unintelligent brethren

and serve as nature's verdant watchers. Several breeds of

leshy exist, each being kindred to a broad group of plants

or fungi. Among the best known are superstitious gourd

leshys, wise seaweed leshys, strange fungus leshys, and

wary leaf leshys, though others are rumored to exist, such

as the surly cactus leshy, the sinister f lytrap leshy, the

garrulous snapdragon leshy, and the enigmatic lotus leshy.

Leshys begin their existence as sentient though bodiless

spirits of nature of the sort contacted by spells such as

commune with nature. These spirits normally have no way

to directly manipulate the physical world, but a skilled

spellcaster (typically a druid) can grow a special plant body

for one of these spirits, giving the spirit a home to animate.

Once accepted into a body, a leshy's spirit remains

within unless the body is destroyed. Leshys do not fear

death as many other creatures do, knowing that should

they fall, their spirits merely return to the natural world

and can be called to inhabit a new leshy body at some

point in the future. As a leshy's body dies, the magic

animating it unravels in a burst of life energy that infuses

its surrounding and quickens the growth of any plants in

the vicinity. Some leshys even voluntarily discorporate

to save the lives of ailing plants, knowing that their

sacrifice may mean the continuation of countless

otherwise helpless f lora. Regardless of how a leshy dies,

leaving the body traumatizes the spirit, and the leshy

retains only faint memories of past corporeal existences.

Leshy spirits need not return to the same form if bound

again to a body. During the course of its existence a single

spirit can inhabit any number of different types of leshys.

A leshy without a body has no power to affect or contact

the material world.

The rites and special materials required to create a

leshy's physical form vary between individual leshys. Once

the creator assembles the necessary materials, a leshy must

typically be grown in an area of natural power, such as a

treant's grove, a druidic circle, or a site of pristine natural

wonder. A newly born leshy is a free-willed, neutral being,

under no obligation to serve its creator.

As a group, leshys share certain common attributes.

They resemble plants but with vaguely humanoid

appearances, and are always Small. While leshys of the

same species share the same general shape, leshys have

all the diversity of the plant world in appearance. For

example, one fungus leshy may have a classic red, whitedotted

mushroom cap, while another might have the

spongier and darker contours of a morel, while a third

might have the coloration of a pale gray cave mushroom.

GROWING A LESHY

The process of growing a leshy has some similarities

to making a construct, but doesn't require the Craft

Construct feat. Typically, the creator of a leshy must

be a powerful druid, but anyone capable of making the

required Knowledge checks and casting the required

spells may attempt the process.

Growing a leshy body takes 2 weeks per Hit Die, during

which the nascent form must be well fertilized, watered

as needed, and kept safe from harm. During this period

of growth, certain rare nutrients and fertilizer must be

used to prime the leshy's transformation from a normal

plant into a sentient one-the cost of these components

varies according to the leshy, but is never less than 1,000

gp. The cultivator must make a successful Knowledge

check at this time (usually a Knowledge [nature] check)

in order for the plant body to be properly formed-the

exact check as well as the required DC varies according to

the leshy. If the check fails, the plant withers and dies and

the cultivator must begin anew.

If, on the other hand, the skill check is successful,

the cultivator must then step in and perform a 24-hour

ritual within a day of the leshy's cultivation. During this

ritual, the cultivator must cast a number of spells (see

each individual leshy for a list). At the ritual's climax,

there's a f lat 50% chance that the attempt to create a leshy

succeeds-if this final check fails, no appropriate spirit

is close enough to answer the call. The plant body rots

and the creator must begin anew with fresh materials if

he wishes to try again. At the GM's discretion, this final

chance for success might increase to 75% or even 100% for

particularly magical areas where leshy spirits are much

more common than normal. Discovering such a rare and

magical site should be the focus of its own adventure.

If the ritual is successful, the leshy awakens fully

formed and able to serve as a minion. A freshly created

leshy is under no particular compulsion to obey its creator,

but most regard their makers as friends and allies.

Plant creatures are particularly adept at growing

leshys. Such creators gain a +5 racial bonus on their

Knowledge checks, halve the time required to grow the

leshy, and reduce the cost to create the creature by 25%.

A plant creature is always successful in luring a spirit

into the body, and need not make the final percentile

roll for success.

Leshys with more Hit Dice than normal can be created.

Each additional Hit Die adds 2,250 gp to the cost of creating

the leshy (and thus 4,500 gp to the overall price), increases

the DC of the Knowledge check by +2, and requires an

additional 2 weeks of growth. Attempts to create leshys

larger than


	SIZE:S


	always fail-the strange spiritual

energies that animate these creatures are only capable of

doing so to a body no larger than that of a human child.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Puffball (Ex) A fungus leshy can spit a puffball as a standard

action. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this

damage is not modified by Strength) and affects the target

struck (but not adjacent targets) with the fungus leshy's

spores. The puffball has a range increment of 20 feet.

Spores (Ex) A fungus leshy is riddled with molds and spores.

Anytime a fungus leshy takes damage, a cloud of spores

bursts from its body, forcing all adjacent creatures to make

a DC 14 Fortitude save or have their vision reduced to 10

feet for 1 minute. Spending a full-round action to wash

one's eyes with water ends this effect. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Keepers of cavernous mushroom forests

and rotting compost pits deep within

the swamp, fungus leshys preside over

subterranean growth and the rot that

fertilizes new life. Among the most

alien and monstrous-looking of all leshys, these tiny rot

farmers' frightening appearance has more to do with the

asymmetrical eeriness intrinsic to molds and fungi than

an outward expression of evil. Like all their kin, fungus

leshys vary widely in form, often adopting the colors and

shapes of the mushrooms and other large fungi common

to the areas they tend.

Fungus leshys are spawned from realms of underground

wonder or the rotting places of the natural world. They

perform an important service in the lands they keep,

encouraging the growth of fungi, transporting rotting

material to fertilize other plants, and making the most use

of growth that has died off. Fungus leshys are most active

at night and spend the day in the forms of plump fungi

amid their ripest compost heaps or fungal glens.

Fungus leshys are 2 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds, their

spongy interiors full of hollows and f luffy spores.

GROWING A FUNGUS LESHY

A fungus leshy is usually grown amid the compost of a

treant's groves, in dens of mold deep underground, or in

eerie hillocks at the heart of dense swamplands.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Ensnare (Ex) The seeds and

slam attack of a gourd leshy

entangle the target in vines

for 2d4 rounds unless the

target makes a DC 12 Reflex

save. The target can

attempt to burst these

entangling vines before

the duration expires

with a DC 12 Strength

check as a full-round action. The save

and burst DCs are Constitution-based.

Keepsake (Su) Gourd leshys can pop off the

top of their heads and store a single Finesized

object such as a dagger or potion inside.

While within the leshy's head, the item is warded by

nondetection. In addition, after 24 hours, the item within is

cleaned and polished, and, if damaged, repaired as if by a

mending spell. Both spell effects have a caster level equal to

twice the leshy's Hit Dice (CL 2nd for most gourd leshys).

Seed (Ex) A gourd leshy can hurl its seeds as a ranged attack.

If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage

is not modified by Strength) and affects the target with

the gourd leshy's ensnare ability. This attack has a 10-foot

range increment.

With tangles of leafy vines for limbs and a carved gourd for

a head, gourd leshys present a rather comical appearance.

Intimately connected with the harvest season, gourd

leshys see to the health and sustainable harvest of crops,

especially vegetables and grains.

Superstition and love of rituals run deep in gourd

leshys. They do their best to exactly reproduce what

worked before with every trivial activity, and change

seemingly random details when attempting tasks they

previously failed. Gourd leshys collect random odds and

ends as good luck charms, ranging from polished stones

to bird feathers to tarnished coins. Credulous to a fault,

gourd leshys believe nearly anything they hear from those

they trust. However, their admittedly hollow heads still

hold memories, and a gourd leshy betrayed rarely forgets.

As gourd leshys aren't particularly strong, they often

fight dirty. One favorite trick is to wait for an

enemy to come within striking distance

while in gourd form so that they can

assume their true form and make a

sneak attack in the same round.

GROWING A GOURD

LESHY

Gourd leshys grow best in small

vegetable patches or in sunny

meadows. Carving eyes and a mouth

into a growing gourd leshy's "face"

is an important part of the

growth ritual, for neglecting

to do this robs the gourd leshy

of its ability to see or speak. The

exact nature and appearance of a

gourd leshy's features can vary

wildly between individuals.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Glide (Ex) A leaf leshy cannot use its fly speed to hover. When

flying, a leaf leshy must end its movement at least 5 feet

lower in elevation than it started.

Seedpods (Ex) Leaf leshys sprout explosive acorns, pine

cones, or other seedpods, and can hurl these as ranged

attacks. A seedpod has a range increment of 10 feet and

detonates on contact to deal 1 point of bludgeoning

damage (this damage is not modified by Strength).

Anyone struck by a seedpod must succeed at a DC 11

Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 round. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Leaf leshys tend to the well-being of trees, whether

natural stands or cultivated orchards. In appearance, they

have soft, pulpy-looking bodies and wear clothing made

of dozens of leaves. Larger leaves cover their shoulders,

often giving them the appearance of wearing cloaks,

and most adorn their relatively featureless heads with

helmets made from pine cones, nuts, or fruit rinds. This

leafy layer of clothing functions as masterwork padded

armor for a leaf leshy, but not for any other creature.

Leaf leshys love to play at war. When not laboring on

their trees, they wheedle any companions to engage in

mock duels with their twig spears, resorting to private

weapon drills when they must. In actual battle, they are

much more cautious, sticking to cover and harrying their

foes with hit-and-run tactics, as they have a strongly

developed sense of self-preservation.

GROWING A LEAF LESHY

Leaf leshys are usually grown under the shade of fruit or

nut trees. To grow a leaf leshy, the maker plants an acorn

and pine cone together, then mounds up leaves, sticks, and

needles around them. When first born, a leaf leshy has no

armor, leafy cape, or weapon, but can construct them from

available materials given a day and left to its own devices

(no Craft check required).

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Air Cyst (Su) Seaweed leshys

constantly grow small bulbs

filled with air. As a move

action, they can detach a bulb

and give it to another creature. If

consumed as a standard action, this

air cyst grants water breathing (as

the spell) for 10 minutes. Seaweed

leshys can have a maximum of four

usable air cysts at any one time, and air

cysts regrow at a rate of one per 24 hours.

Water Jet (Ex) A seaweed leshy can expel a highpressure

jet of water from its mouth to a range of

30 feet. It must make a ranged touch attack to strike

a target-if it hits, the blast deals 1 point of bludgeoning

damage (this damage is not modified by Strength). In

addition, the creature hit must make a DC 15 Fortitude

save or be blinded by the water for 1 round. The save DC is

Dexterity-based.

Seaweed leshys usually dwell along coastlines, happily

splashing and playing in tide pools, but they are equally

at home at sea, f loating among large kelp beds. Although

perfectly capable of existing out of water indefinitely,

seaweed leshys prefer to limit their time away from the

sea almost out of a sense of pride. Most seaweed leshys

take a dim view of freshwater plant life, to the point of

mocking such plants in the same way an urbanite might

talk down to folk who live in more rural areas. Rumors of

freshwater leshys are a sure way to bring peals of mocking

laughter from a seaweed leshy.

Seaweed leshys resemble miniature, waterlogged green

humans grown from leafy green seaweed, with skinny

arms and legs, webbed hands and feet, and long strands

of brown, green, or red seaweed for hair. They wear armor

made from a pair of large clam shells or from several

smaller shells tied together. This armor

functions as a suit of masterwork padded

armor for a seaweed leshy, but not for any

other creature.

Patient and thoughtful by inclination

(save for matters associated with those

silly freshwater leshys), seaweed leshys

believe that in time nature brings

what is needed by the ebb and f low of

the tide or the steady f low of the river.

They counsel against hasty decisions and

rash actions, always preferring to wait and

see what another day might bring.

GROWING A SEAWEED LESHY

Seaweed leshys must be grown in seawater.

The leshy's maker plants a strand of kelp

or other seaweed in the water and treats

it daily with bone ash to encourage

algal growth. When first created, a

seaweed leshy has no armor, but can

construct it from available materials

given a day and left to its own devices (no

Craft check required).

Linnorm

Treacherous primeval dragons of the northern regions of

the world, linnorms thrive on their hatred for those they

deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inf lict as much

suffering as possible unto their unfortunate victims.

Sweeping bones and treasures alike into giant piles in its

lair, the typical linnorm has a barbaric nature made all

the worse by its insatiable greed and atrocious gluttony.

Few creatures are as bold and as cruel as linnorms, and

for that most people are thankful.

Linnorms are not true dragons, but they nonetheless

possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often

rival authentic dragon brutality. Their massive frames

make crushing smaller enemies a simple task, and of

those who have felt the sting of a linnorm's venomous

bite, few have survived the devastating poison long

enough to tell the tale. A linnorm's body is serpentine

and lacks wings, yet these dragons f ly through the air

with supernatural ease, accomplishing the feat as easily

as a fish through water.

Beyond the physical might, venom, and devastating

breath weapons typical of all linnorms, the beasts all

share a potent final defense-the death curse. This

powerful plaguing of the mind manifests itself in myriad

forms, but always serves as a horrid vengeance against

any who might manage to slay a linnorm. Some theorize

that the curse is a sending from malevolent gods who

watch over linnorms and view them as destructionloving

pets. Others believe the linnorms' curse is the

closest remaining connection they have to the primeval

world of the fey, from whence the first of these monsters

is said to have come. Whatever the case may be, its curse

makes killing a linnorm as dangerous as letting it live.

True dragons of higher intellect often hold linnorms

in great scorn, viewing the beings as prematurely evolved

beasts and refusing to even acknowledge the creatures as

related to them. Linnorms have few feelings regarding

the matter, battling younger and older dragons alike

just as readily as any other creatures who dare to step

foot in their territories. Their simplemindedness stif les

any ability to assemble mass sieges or even cooperate

in small groups, so linnorms almost always function

alone, individually hunting over large territories in order

to waylay as many travelers as possible. Linnorms only

seek a mate once during their long lifetimes, the female

producing several clutches of up to six eggs as a result.

Of these eggs, only one will survive-the first to hatch

immediately feasts on its unhatched brethren.

Despite their lust for devastation, linnorms usually

live in relatively remote areas, never straying far from the

northernmost reaches of the world. As they are universally

hated and feared by most other intelligent creatures,

their tendency to dwell in more isolated regions helps

ensure their survival; while linnorms are vicious and

unforgiving, their lack of organization makes them

highly susceptible to raiding parties seeking to eradicate

their presence, though such parties would need to be

made up of truly impressive individuals. More often than

not, a linnorm resides totally undisturbed in the spot

it chooses as its own for hundreds of years, stewing in

its own malevolence until finally snapping and going

on a rampage. Sometimes, villages aren't even aware

of a slumbering linnorm's proximity, but usually such

settlements have long traditions and local legends

revolving around "their linnorm." Since a linnorm can

hibernate for centuries, villages composed of shorterlived

humanoids might consider these tales as little more

than quaint stories, but when the linnorm wakes, the

truth becomes impossible to doubt.

Linnorms come in many different varieties, but all

share the qualities of being horribly strong and bestial.

They feast solely on meat, usually eating goats and other

mountain animals when more intelligent creatures

such as humanoids don't readily present themselves.

Linnorms are prone to gorging and then falling into a

deep sleep near their treasure hordes, waking either

when they become aware of intruders in their vicinity or

to feed once more.

The linnorms presented on the following pages

represent only four of their kind. The most legendary

linnorms are the crag linnorm, ice linnorm, and tarn

linnorm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary), but others exist as well.

Rumors of even more powerful unique linnorms persist

in lands where these dragons are well-known and feared.

The largest of their kind, unique linnorms are never less

powerful than tor linnorms (who are often mistakenly

thought to be the most dangerous species).

LINNORM SPECIAL ABILITIES

While each linnorm has several unique powers, they all

share certain abilities in common, as detailed below.

In addition to these, every linnorm possesses a breath

weapon and a poisonous attack, but the specific effects of

these attacks vary from species to species.

Death Curse (Su): When a creature slays a linnorm,

it becomes targeted by that linnorm's death curse. The

exact effects of a death curse vary, depending upon the

type of linnorm. The save DC of a linnorm's death curse

is always Charisma-based.

Freedom of Movement (Ex): A linnorm has continuous

freedom of movement, as per the spell of the same name.

This ability cannot be dispelled.

True Seeing (Ex): A linnorm has continuous true

seeing, as per the spell of the same name. This ability

cannot be dispelled.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds

as a standard action, a cairn linnorm

can expel a 60-foot cone of

acidic bile, dealing 18d8 points of

acid damage to all creatures

struck. In addition, this bile is

infused with negative energy,

and inflicts 1d4 negative

levels on all creatures struck

by it. A successful DC 28 Reflex

save halves the damage and

completely negates the negative levels. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Death Curse (Su) Curse of Decay: save Will DC 28; effect the

creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage per day, and

ages at an accelerated rate of 1 year per day, eventually

incurring all of the penalties of old age but none of the

benefits (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169).

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for

10 rounds; effect 4d6 acid damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 2

consecutive saves.

Cairn linnorms prefer to dwell in necropolises, amid

reaches of burial mounds, or in caverns below the scorched

earth of legendary battlefields. These linnorms particularly

relish the flavor of undead flesh-while they cannot

consume incorporeal undead, regions they haunt are

typically barren of corporeal undead not canny enough to

avoid the cairn linnorm's ravenous appetite. An incredibly

powerful undead creature might use a cairn linnorm as a

guardian, manipulating the dragon while it selects a cairn

or tomb well within the linnorm's territory. While cairn

linnorms will not hesitate to feed on undead creatures

they encounter, some ancient superstition shared by all of

their kind prevents them from actually entering a tomb or

other enclosed burial site unless granted permission by

the tomb's undead denizens or a priest devoted to the

religion associated with the site. Likewise, a cairn

linnorm somehow caught within a tomb large

enough to contain it prefers not to leave without

securing similar permission to

do so. These limitations are

purely psychological, and

if pressed (such as by an

enemy seeking to use a tomb

entrance as a defense), a cairn

linnorm can break such restrictions.

A cairn linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs

12,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard

action, a fjord linnorm can expel a 120-foot line of icy fluid,

dealing 16d8 points of cold damage to all creatures struck

(Reflex DC 27 for half damage). The freezing liquid quickly

hardens to sheets of ice, causing any creature that takes

damage to move at only half its normal speed for 1d4 rounds.

A DC 27 Strength check made as a full-round action allows

a character to break free of the ice before this duration

expires. The save DC and Strength check DC are

Constitution-based.

Death Curse (Su) Curse of Drowning: save Will DC 26;

effect creature can never gain the benefit of water

breathing, and if it possesses this ability,

loses it as long as it suffers the

curse. In addition, the creature

can hold its breath only half as

long as normal, and whenever the cursed creature holds its

breath, it functions as if sickened.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for

10 rounds; effect 3d6 cold damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 2

consecutive saves.

Fjord linnorms dwell among the deep waters that grace

northern coastlines where fingers of land create complex

rivulets, venturing out to sea to feed on sharks and whales

when they cannot find settlements or traveling caravans to

savage. As their favored haunts often overlap with coastal

trade routes, regions known to be within the territory of a

fjord linnorm are often avoided by ships. Fjord linnorms

are not particularly adept at capsizing ships, as are some

other large aquatic monsters, but one might argue that

such tactics are unnecessary for a creature the size and

power of a fjord linnorm in the first place.

Both the curse and poison of a fjord linnorm are

extremely dangerous for those who frequent the waterways

of the north. The fjord linnorm's curse is particularly

devastating to aquatic creatures, and such beings are

careful to avoid any possible conf lict with such linnorms.

A f jord linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs just over

10,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Breath Weapon (Su) Once

every 1d4 rounds as

a standard action, a

taiga linnorm can

expel a 60-foot

cone of electrified

vapor, dealing 21d8

points of electricity damage

to all creatures struck (Reflex

DC 30 for half). The

vapor itself persists

for 1d4 rounds,

filling its

cone-shaped

area with

electrified mist that deals 4d6 points of electricity damage (no

save) to any creature that ends its turn in the mist. The mist

does not hinder vision. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Death Curse (Su) Curse of Electrocution: save Will DC 29; effect

the creature gains vulnerability to electricity.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round

for 10 rounds; effect 4d6 electricity damage and 1d8 Dex

drain; cure 3 consecutive saves.

Spines (Ex) Any creature that makes a melee attack against

a taiga linnorm takes 1d6 points of piercing damage per

attack from the linnorm's spines. A melee weapon with

reach provides protection from these spines.

A beast covered with hundreds of spines, the taiga linnorm

is a terror to all those who venture through the arctic

forests of the north. Taiga linnorms take down foes and

prey first with their electrifying breath and finish their

victims off with their devastating bite.

In winter, when light is sparse and the nights are long, it

is easy for a taiga linnorm to blend in with the coniferous

forests it dwells in, hiding among the trees and ambushing

imprudent travelers or unwary adventurers setting up

camp. A taiga linnorm often lies in wait for days-

sometimes weeks-just for the opportunity to maim and

devour unsuspecting victims. When this subtler tactic

does not work, a taiga linnorm simply rampages through

the woods in order to find nearby settlements to pillage,

taking twisted delight in shocking the inhabitants before

shredding them with its massive jaws or destructive

forelimbs. In any event, taiga linnorms rarely venture far

from their woodland territories save for short f lights to

attack outlying villages.

A taiga linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs just over

13,000 pounds.

Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a

standard action, a tor linnorm can expel a 60-

foot cone of flame and ash, dealing 24d8

points of fire damage to all creatures

struck (Reflex DC 33 for half damage).

One round after this breath weapon

is used, the area affected

by the attack becomes

covered in a cloud

of thick,

scorching

smoke that

burns both

the lungs and eyes, dealing an additional 8d8 points of fire

damage to all creatures in the area. Each creature that begins

its turn in the smoke-covered area and breathes must make

a DC 33 (+ 1 per previous check) Fortitude save each round or

spend that round choking and coughing. Creatures that keep

their eyes open for more than 1 round while in the area of the

smoke must make a DC 33 Fortitude save or go blind for 1d3

hours. The smoke dissipates after 2d4 rounds. This duration is

halved in strong winds and quartered in more powerful winds.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Death Curse (Su) Curse of Boiling Blood: save Will DC 31;

effect creature gains vulnerability to fire and is permanently

staggered from the pain of its boiling blood. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Lava Affinity (Ex) A tor linnorm can breathe and swim while

submerged in lava and magma.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 33; frequency 1/round

for 10 rounds; effect 8d6 fire damage and 1d8 Con drain;

cure 3 consecutive saves.

Tor linnorms epitomize the raw and untempered power

of their kin. They dwell in the tallest volcanic mountains,

either in naturally formed caverns or in the craters

themselves, and rain destruction down upon nearby

mountain villages whenever the urge strikes them. Tor

linnorms are brutes, but as far as linnorms go are relatively

intelligent. With this intelligence comes an overwhelming

vanity-unlike other linnorms, tor linnorms enjoy being

adored and worshiped by lesser creatures, and have

been known to delay eating prisoners who seem to

be particularly cowed by their presence, simply

basking in their victims' fear.

A tor linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs

15,000 pounds.

Expert Climber (Ex) A gecko's feet allow it to climb virtually

any surface, no matter how slick or sheer. In effect, geckos

are treated as constantly being under a natural version of

the spell spider climb.

These lizards are mostly docile and shy away from attacking

creatures larger than a cat or dog. Despite their shyness,

they are ultimately curious creatures, and often approach

bigger creatures simply to investigate. Of course, a

giant gecko is more than capable of defending

itself, biting creatures that

react violently to the

lizard when f leeing

is not an option.

Some humanoids

train giant geckos as

bestial guardians. Smaller

humanoids (in particular, goblins) can

even use the creatures as mounts, taking

advantage of their superior climbing skills to

attack from seemingly impossible positions

and angles. A giant gecko measures 8 feet

from nose to tail and weighs 120 pounds.

vary wildly, though most are some

shade of green.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Damage Reduction (Ex) A lukwata's damage

reduction is penetrated only by nonmagical

weapons (temporary magical weapons, such as

those created by the spell magic weapon and

similar effects, count as magical weapons).

Digest Magic (Su) A magic item swallowed by a

lukwata must make a DC 22 Fortitude save after

an hour or become permanently nonmagical.

Artifacts are immune to this effect. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Dispelling Bite (Su) When a lukwata scores a critical hit with

its bite, the victim is affected as if targeted by a greater

dispel magic spell. The caster level for this effect is equal to

the lukwata's Hit Dice (CL 14th for most lukwatas).

Eldritch Encrustation (Su) Crystalline growths along the

lukwata's digestive tract contain large deposits of

magical energy. These nodes are responsible

for the magical feedback that surrounds each

lukwata, granting it its spell resistance, damage

reduction, dispelling bite, and digest magic

abilities. Dispel magic cast on a lukwata can negate these

powers for 1 minute-the CL of the effect is treated as the

lukwata's Hit Dice (CL 11th for most lukwatas).

Lukwatas slip through dark tropical waters, preying upon

all who dare enter their deep jungle rivers and pools,

including beasts typically considered apex predators.

While scholars say the beasts favor the dark, light doesn't

deter them in their relentless pursuit of prey. Their long,

f lat bodies are reminiscent of those of dolphins or large

fish, but lukwatas' heads are distinctively eel-like. A

lukwata's unusual ability to disrupt magical effects rises

from the strange crystalline growths that line its throat and

stomach-crystals that allow the lukwata to gain nutrients

from magical items as efficiently as from flesh and blood.

These same growths give the lukwata an unusually strong

resistance to all manner of magic attacks.

Lukwatas hate crocodiles, their chief predatory rivals,

and attack them on sight, even if the lukwata has recently

fed. Most crocodilians are not large enough to pose

a significant threat; however, some accounts exist of

lukwatas and dire crocodiles

crossing paths. These

fights are renowned

for inf licting great

destruction, with the

embattled creatures

smashing to bits piers,

f lotillas, and even dams in

their fury.

A lukwata is 20 feet long

and weighs 4,000 pounds.

other treasure)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Paired Weapons (Ex) Because of its intense

training wielding a scimitar in each hand,

a maftet's off-hand scimitar is treated as a

light weapon.

Raptor Dive (Ex) When airborne, a maftet can swoop down

and strike at lightning speed. This is equivalent to an aerial

charge, but it must move downward at least 10 feet and

may dive at twice its normal flying speed. Doing so grants

the maftet a +2 bonus on its attack rolls and allows it to

make a full attack at the end of the raptor dive.

Runic Tattoos (Su) The tattoos scribed on a maftet's body

power its spell-like abilities and glow when those abilities

are used. A maftet can activate up to two of its spell-like

abilities as a standard action. It may make a Fortitude save

to resist the effects of an erase spell cast on its tattoos, but

if it fails, it loses access to its spell-like abilities for 24 hours.

Dwelling in crumbling ruins and lost cities, maftets are a

race of winged feline humanoids. Accomplished hunters

and stalkers, maftets are highly skilled in fighting with

dual scimitars.

A typical maftet is 7 feet tall and weighs 270 pounds.

The fur on their leonine bodies ranges in coloration from

a light buff to goldenrod or rust red. In some climates,

maftets have the spotted lower bodies of leopards, and in

rare circumstances they may possess white fur and pale

skin or black fur and grayish-purple skin. Such individuals

frequently rise to positions of power among their kind.

At home in dry deserts and mountains, maftets prefer

to lair in abandoned ruins, mysteriously drawn to such

desolate places. They also make do with dens in cliffside

caves or mountaintop eyries, but only if no suitable

abandoned edifices can be found.

When a young maftet comes of age, it receives its runic

tattoos from a shaman, usually the eldest female in the

pride. The art and magic of creating these tattoos has been

passed down from mother to daughter for thousands of

years, along with the race's oral history and legends. Their

origins now lost to history, these tattoos are always the

same (with minor cosmetic variations between the sexes

and between different prides) and always have the same

effects. Under no circumstances are these tattoos ever

given to non-maftets.

ECOLOGY

Treasure standard

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Heated Flesh (Ex) Any metal

weapon striking a magmin

must succeed at a DC 14

Fortitude save or melt and

gain the broken condition.

Another strike by the same

weapon causes the metal

weapon to be destroyed if

it fails a second save. Wood

weapons are destroyed after only

one failed save. Unarmed and

natural attacks made against the

magmin deal 1 point of fire damage

to the attacker. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Searing Aura (Ex) A magmin radiates

extremely high temperatures, and

any creature that starts its turn

within 20 feet of a magmin must

succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire

damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

While magmins populate the Plane of Fire, they sometimes

slip through elemental rifts into the Material Plane.

These rifts usually occur in places of searing heat, such as

volcanoes or underground rivers of magma, or in places of

strong, unpredictable magic. The latter scenario usually

results in more problematic entrances, as magmins tend

to accidently set fire to any nearby f lammable objects.

Though not courageous, these small outsiders still

make formidable foes against any creature without

resistance to their intense heat. Their touch incinerates

clothing, and creatures that strike their bodies with steel

run the risk of reducing their weapons to slag. Magmins'

best defense in their homes on the Plane of Fire is in their

sheer numbers. Their settlements, dotted with magma

pools and leaping geysers of molten rock, teem with

staggering numbers of the creatures.

Magmins are paranoid and untrusting. Always fearful

of the larger denizens of the Plane of Fire, magmins

harangue any interlopers with dozens of

questions, asking where they

are going, where they came

from, and what they are

doing near the magmins'

precious magma pools.

If travelers' answers

are unsatisfactory, the

magmins try to shuff le

the creatures off as

quickly as possible. Those

who refuse to leave risk

being thrown into a pool

of liquid rock.

Magmins take great

pride in the cultivation

of their magma pools.

Each magma pool has a

different purpose, such

as bathing, cooking meals,

or relaxation. Magmins add

minerals and salts to these

pools to properly season them

for their intended uses. Cooking

pools (sometimes called "murder

pools" by strangers) burn hotter

than most others, and relaxation

pools are generally darker than

bathing pools.

Upon reaching adulthood, magmins

stand 4 feet tall, their dense compositions

giving them a weight of 300 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Separate (Su) During the day, a manananggal looks like a

living human woman. She does not detect as undead

during the day, but is still an undead creature. At night,

her upper torso rips away (this is a full round action that

occurs at sunset), leaving her lower torso behind. Her

lower torso is helpless, but her upper torso gains its fly

speed and natural attacks at this time. The upper and lower

portions share the same pool of hit points (despite any

intervening distance), and if the helpless lower portion is

damaged, the manananggal is immediately aware of the

attack. Since manananggals can be destroyed by damage

to their lower bodies, they prefer to hide their lower torsos

when separated. A manananggal must return to its lower

torso and reattach to it (a full-round action) within the

hour before sunrise-each round a manananggal remains

separated after sunrise, it takes 1d6 points of damage until

it rejoins its lower torso or it crumbles into dust.

Vulnerable to Light Blades (Ex): Light blades (such as daggers,

kamas, kukris, rapiers, short swords, sickles, and starknives)

deal double the weapon's base damage on a successful hit

against a manananggal.

Horrid undead, manananggals walk among the living by

day and prey upon them at night. These creatures delight

in spreading fear and distrust. By day, they tend to stay

inside because of their light sensitivity. They mask this odd

behavior by either living just outside villages as reclusive

hermits or by obtaining roles within the community that

explain away or justify their eccentricities.

Manananggals pass themselves off as normal people,

usually posing as mad old women, midwives, hedge

witches, or mystics. This allows the undead creatures

to select their prey from within the community.

Manananggals particularly enjoy feeding upon pregnant

women, targeting them in their sleep so the undead may

feast on the blood of both mothers and the children they

carry. These foul creatures drain blood via their long,

black, hollow tongues. Manananggals despise the scent

of garlic and strong spices like cloves and anise.

As they f ly through the night, manananggals make a

ticking or clicking sound, leading some villagers to call

the creatures "tik-tiks." Once separated, a manananggal's

mobile torso has a 6-foot wingspan.

These strange-looking animals have long pointy ears and

pronounced muzzles, and their strong legs carry them

about in amazing leaps. Like all marsupials, kangaroos

give birth to live young ("joeys") that are relatively

undeveloped at birth and completely helpless, and must

remain within a protective pouch on the mother's belly for

months before safely emerging.

While not particularly dangerous, a kangaroo

is more than capable of defending itself if

cornered or when forced to protect its

young, striking out at foes with

a powerful kick capable of

knocking unwary antagonists

off their feet.

A kangaroo stands over 6-1/2

feet tall and weighs upward of 200

pounds. To represent a smaller

species standing about 4 feet

tall and weighing 110 pounds,

apply the young simple template

or manually reduce the size from

Medium to Small. Kangaroos

reach maturity in less than a

year and can live up to 20 years,

but most individuals in the

wild are hunted by predators

within their first decade.

An ancient relative of the smaller leatherback sea turtle,

bite, and doesn't hesitate to use it to

deter aquatic nuisances.

Like other sea turtles, female

archelons come ashore to lay and bury

their eggs in sandy beaches,

preferably facing deep

water and without coral

reefs. Once done, they

return to the sea,

leaving their eggs

defenseless.

These creatures

are often used

by coastal tribes as guardians

particularly locathah, often

use them as beasts of burden,

Despite their saurian name, basilosauruses are in

fact oceanic mammals, and at 60 feet in length are

highly formidable beasts of the sea. In appearance,

they resemble greatly elongated whales, but with long,

toothed jaws resembling an alligator's.

Inexperienced observers often

confuse a basilosaurus with

a sea serpent or water orm-

and in all fairness, in the

aftermath of a basilosaurus

attack on an unsuspecting

ship, such distinctions are largely

academic anyway.

A basilosaurus relies as much on

vision as echolocation to find prey,

but sometimes mistakes smaller

ships for food. Basilosauruses

have few natural predators; only

supernatural monsters like krakens,

thalassic behemoths, and the largest of sea

serpents can truly threaten a fully grown one.

for a typical mobogo). A mobogo does not

gain the grappled condition when using its

tongue to grapple a foe.

Vile Croak (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a

mobogo can unleash a thunderous croak. Any non-boggard

or non-mobogo within 50 feet of the mobogo must make

a DC 19 Will save or become staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Once a creature makes its saving throw against a particular

mobogo's vile croak, it is immune to that mobogo's croak

for 24 hours. Any boggards or mobogos within the area of a

mobogo's vile croak gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls

and saving throws against fear effects for 1 round. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Huge and hungry, mobogos merge the features of gigantic

toads and swampy dragons, and lair in the deepest, oldest

swamps. Here, whole tribes of boggards serve the beasts'

fickle, capricious whims.

Mobogos reside in the most primal swamps of the

world, grotesque eldritch wildernesses unchanged for

centuries. Boggards believe that in ancient times, after

their fecund demon goddess deposited her frogspawn in

the muddy morass of the world's still-forming continents,

mobogos were among the first creatures to emerge. Ever

since, the mobogos have slept and fed, preying upon the

beasts of their fetid meres, growing huge and lethargic,

and dreaming inscrutable amphibious dreams of their

godly mother's return. Nearly all mobogos are attended

by tribes of boggards. Mobogos care little for matters of

origins and philosophies-they care only for the endless

sacrifices of food, victims, and pleasing swamp art brought

to them by their obedient tribes.

A mobogo is 18 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Wisdom Drain (Su) A creature that takes rend

damage from a moon-beast must succeed at a DC

22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. A

moon-beast heals 5 points of damage for each point of

Wisdom it drains in this manner. If it drains a victim to

0 Wisdom, the moon-beast gains the effects of a heal spell.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Moon-beasts have no voice or eyes, yet they "see" more

than most and can project their thoughts into the very

minds of those they wish to communicate with. These

monstrosities hail not from any physical moon, but rather

from the shared satellite of all slumbering minds in the

Dimension of Dream beyond the wall of sleep. Here, the

moon-beasts raise stone cities on the oily shores of nightblack

seas found upon the dark side of the dreaming

moon, from which they launch long, dark galleys crewed

by not-quite-human slaves that sail through the void of

space down to the seas of the Dimension of Dream to seek

new slaves and stranger, more sinister wares.

Moon-beasts are slavers, first and foremost. They use

their spell-like abilities to curb rebellion or to quickly

gain minions, but much prefer using physical and mental

regimens of torment and reconditioning to break the

spirit of their captives. They often work with the denizens

of Leng, a metaphysically nearby dimension of nightmare

and madness, although as often as not these planar

neighbors serve the moon-beasts merely as slaves.

Worshipers of ageless entities from beyond the stars,

moon-beasts are often compelled to travel to the Material

Plane for strange and frightening causes, not the least

of which is gathering suitable

sacrifices for their mysterious

and demanding lords.

A moon-beast is 9

feet long and weighs

800 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Disease (Su) Purple Pox: inhaled or

injury; save Fort DC 15;

onset 1 minute;

frequency 1/day; effect

1d2 Wis and 1d2 Con

damage; cure 2 consecutive

saves. A creature that dies

of the purple pox becomes

bloated over the course

of 24 hours, after which its

body bursts open, releasing a

fully grown myceloid. Additionally, as

long as a creature takes at least 7 points of Wisdom damage

from the purple pox, it must make a DC 15 Will save each

day to avoid becoming affected by a lesser geas (no HD

limit) that compels the sickly character to seek out the

nearest myceloid colony in order to offer itself up for spore

domination. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Spore Cloud (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a myceloid

can expel a 10-foot-radius burst of spores centered on itself.

This cloud persists for 1d3 rounds. Any creature caught

in this cloud or that moves through it is exposed to the

myceloid's purple pox disease-a creature need save only

once against any one spore cloud, however, before becoming

permanently immune to that particular spore cloud's effects.

The spore cloud does not hamper vision.

Spore Domination (Sp) This spell-like ability functions

as charm monster, but functions only against creatures

currently infected with purple pox.

The walking fungi known as myceloids feed off of

decaying organic matter like many other fungi, yet

unlike typical mushrooms or molds, they take particular

pleasure in feeding from the rotting bodies of humanoids.

Myceloids claim to be able to taste things like

"innocence," "despair," and "hope" in

the ripeness of rancid meat, although

whether this is true or simply part

of the myceloids' twisted sense of

humor is unclear.

Most myceloids have deep

purple caps studded with white

lumps, and paler purple necks and bodies

of tough, leathery fungus. Their spores

grow tenaciously in living flesh,

causing a rapid spread of painful

purple lesions that, in advanced

stages of the sickness, sprout tiny

purple mushrooms; plucking

these mushrooms is painful to

the victim and causes bleeding.

This condition, known as purple

pox, is the method by which

myceloids both season their

meat and procreate.

Myceloids prefer to

capture victims alive

for later infection and

control. To a myceloid,

a living creature has three

uses-first as a slave, second

as a host from which to birth

new myceloids, and finally as

a banquet to feast upon once the

first two destinies have played out.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Hypnosis (Su) Once per day, by weaving and coiling its body

and hissing as a standard action, a lunar naga can cause

its scales to shimmer and glow with moonlike radiance. All

creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17

Will save to avoid becoming fascinated. The

lunar naga can maintain this fascination

effect as long as it concentrates; fascinated

creatures follow the still-glowing naga if it

moves as long as it maintains the

effect by concentrating. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort

DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6

rounds; effect 1d3 Con and 1 Wis; cure 1 save.

Spells A lunar naga casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.

Lunar nagas are patient watchers of the night sky. They

enjoy cosmology and believe strongly in astrology,

maintaining a handful of complex zodiacs. A few lunar

nagas even bear knowledge of the unspeakable things

from the dark spaces between the stars. A lunar naga

stretches over 10 feet from its pale face to the tip of its tail,

and weighs close to 200 pounds.

Nocturnal creatures, lunar nagas often live in ruined

towers or atop mountains-

any place open to the sky

at night. There they peer through astrological devices,

closely monitoring passing celestial markers, eager to

decipher more of the universe. Those living underground

make nightly trips to the open sky when they can. Cloudy

nights make lunar nagas agitated, and a creature is more

likely to run afoul of a lunar naga on these dark evenings.

Lunar nagas sometimes lead small cults of sky-watchers.

These followers aid the nagas in recording tome upon tome

of calculations of the stars and planets moving through

the inky black of the night sky. In small doses tempered

with water, fruit juices, and alcohol, lunar naga venom is

mildly hallucinogenic. The nagas' cultist allies often take

the substance as a ritualistic drug.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Change Shape (Su) A royal naga can use this ability

to take one of five specific humanoid forms. Each

of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a

female dwarf with red hair, an elderly male

human, and so on) and the naga can

only use this ability to assume these

five forms. The naga can still use its

dual gaze in humanoid form.

Dual Gaze (Su) A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of

crippling those that meet its gazes. The creature has two

gaze attacks and can switch between them as a move

action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become

permanently blinded, while the other causes those that

succumb to be permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude

save negates the effects of either gaze; otherwise, the effects

are permanent until cured. Royal nagas generally prefer to

keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the blindness

gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already

been deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be

harmed by gaze attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Spells A royal naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.

Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and

forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their

own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga's five faces are sharp

and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it

becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and

vanity, royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods and faces

with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other

precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and

often weigh more than 750 pounds.

Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding

in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful

of strangers and seem to have great

difficulty speaking to other

creatures as equals.

Spells A water naga casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.

With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas'

serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although

doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in

common with normal snakes than most of their

kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and

lashing out at any creatures that would disturb

them. A typical water naga measures 10 feet long

and weighs 250 pounds.

Where many nagas claim particular lairs

as their homes, water nagas typically have a

number of retreats, migrating from one to the

next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas

keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several

favored shelters positioned between these so they can

make a circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout

the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs,

water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their

sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once

such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all.

As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially

well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs-

usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes-often court

the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich

local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and

pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying

f lattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see

as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their

roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they

quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes

and often embellish the stories they've heard with their

own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such

misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The

congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the

entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with

only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures'

deadly bite.

Crushing Blow (Ex)

When a nephilim makes

a successful critical hit with a melee

attack, the target must make a DC 22

Fortitude save or take an additional

3d6 points of nonlethal damage and

be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.

Mortal Challenge (Su) When a nephilim spends a standard

action to roar a battle challenge, all humanoids and




	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid


	s within 100 feet of the nephilim

must make a DC 18 Will save to avoid becoming frightened

for 5d6 rounds. On a successful save, the creatures only

become shaken for that time. Creatures with more HD

than the nephilim become shaken if they fail their save, and

suffer no effect if they succeed. A creature that succeeds at

the save is immune to that nephilim's mortal challenge for

24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC

is Charisma-based.

Soul of Sorrow (Ex) A nephilim gains a +2 bonus on Will saves

against fear effects and any effect that causes sorrow.

The nephilim are the offspring of demigods who bred

with humans. This joining resulted in a race of giant-sized

beings possessed of a shard of divine power and the

mortal consciousness of humans. A nephilim stands 11

feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds. Its divine heritage

grants it a lifespan of almost 600 years.

Nephilim are a nomadic, secretive race. This

isolationism has only heightened

the wild tales surrounding them,

making it even harder for other

races to trust them. While the

ancient animosity humans once

had against them has been largely

forgotten, zealots occasionally

try to mount pogroms

and crusades to wipe the

nephilim out forever. The

nephilim have proven

strikingly resistant to

these efforts.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Wild Empathy (Ex) This ability works like the druid ability of

the same name. The nixie's total includes a +8 racial bonus

on wild empathy checks.

Nixies are guardians of ponds, rivers, lakes, and

springs. They prefer dwelling in idyllic places,

which they protect from the depredations of

predators and careless humanoids. While this

often involves confusing enemies and driving

foes away, nixies are not afraid of spilling

blood to protect their homes-though they

prefer not to resort to such means unless

completely necessary. Nixies are 4 feet tall

and rarely weigh more than 45 pounds.

Nixies avoid combat if possible, using

charm person to lead humanoids away from

their lairs. They sometimes use this ability

to enslave people to act as protectors or help with a task

that is simply too big for them to deal with. They cast water

breathing on charmed creatures helping with tasks below

the surface. Nixies are reclusive and prefer to keep their

presence hidden. They make lairs underwater, forming

small communities if their numbers are great enough.

Legends speak of a secret nixie kingdom at the bottom of a

great lake, but no one has yet confirmed its location.

BOG NIXIES

In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to

drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets

with song or by assuming the form of an animal or

humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous

waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering

swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog

nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes,

ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as

brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out.

A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced

creature template who has the following additional

powers. A bog nixie's


	CR:is +2 higher than a normal nixie's.

Captivating Song (Su): This works like the harpy ability

of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Change Shape (Su): This works as polymorph, and allows

the bog nixie to assume the form of any


	SIZE:S


	or Medium

aquatic animal or humanoid.

Minor Wish (Sp): Once per day, a bog

nixie can create a magical effect in

exchange for a gift or service from

a humanoid. The power of this

"wish" is no greater than what can

be done with a 3rd-level spell.

Shears (Su) A norn's shears function as a +5 mithral keen speed

scimitar, but only for a norn.

Shift Fate (Su) As an immediate action, a norn can force any one

target within 120 feet to reroll a saving throw-this ability

must be used immediately after the saving throw is rolled,

and the target must abide by the result of this second roll.

Snip Thread (Su) As a standard action up to three times per day

but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a norn may

produce a golden thread linked to a creature's fate and then

attempt to snip it short with her shears. The target creature

must be within 120 feet and in the norn's line of sight. The

target immediately takes 20d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC

30 for half). If the target dies from this damage, the norn has

cut through the thread-in this case, the target may only be

restored to life via miracle, wish, or divine intervention. This is a

death effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.

Ancient beyond imagining, the norns are a race of powerful

women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation

of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch

over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon

or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted

and abused by lesser beings. Worshiped as gods by some,

the norns do little to discourage this veneration.

A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Breath Weapon (Su) A nuckelavee's breath weapon is a

cone of withering foulness that causes painful welts,

cramps, and bleeding, and only harms living creatures-

this damage bypasses all energy resistance and damage

reduction. Non-creature plants in the area are affected as if by

a blight spell. Any creature that fails its Reflex save against the

breath weapon must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or contract

mortasheen (see below). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Disease (Su) Mortasheen: Contact; save Fort DC 21; frequency

1/day; effect 1d4 Con and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive

saves. Animals take a -2 penalty on their saves against this

disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The dreaded nuckelavee is a manifestation of pollution and

filth, be it the natural decay of a red tide or the intrusive

pollution of sewage and other urban waste. A nuckelavee

is a living irony-a carrier of disease and a spreader of

corruption that unleashes its wrath against other sources

that bring corruption into the world. The corruption

spread by nuckelavees only serves to further their own

sense of self-loathing and overall rage. While nuckelavees

might, incidentally, carry out vengeance for the victims

of such pollution, defending the denizens of their rivers,

swamps, and bogs is not their primary drive, for they revel

in inf licting the very corruption they hate and enjoy little

more than watching their enemies sicken and die.

Folktales tell of talismans to carry-fetishes of seaweed

garlands, horsehair soaked in brine, or vials of

sanctified seawater-or of prayers to recite to ward

away nuckelavees or convince them

the bearer is innocent. In truth,

however, these old solutions

offer no protection from the

vile plague-bearers.

A nuckelavee is the same

size as a horse.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Cloud Form (Su) A

nue can change

into the form

of a 10-foot black

cloud or back to its

normal form as a standard

action. A nue in cloud

form is otherwise

treated as if under the

effects of gaseous form, except that it

obscures vision like fog cloud.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 21;

frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect

1d4 Strength damage; cure 2 consecutive

saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This strange creature has the body of a tiger, the head of a

fanged monkey, and a poisonous viper for a tail. Though

some call it a chimera and treat it as an exotic specimen

of that creature, it is a completely different breed of beast.

Intelligent enough to enjoy cruelty as well as inf licting

terror upon its prey, a nue delights in toying with its

victim before dealing the killing blow. Often, a nue will

select a target and plague it with nightmares before it

even attempts an act of violence, wearing down the victim

with dreadful dreams and phantasmagoric terrors. Once

its prey is thoroughly exhausted, the nue will finally

steal into the victim's sleeping chambers and engage in

combat, paralyzing its target with its magic and infecting

its prey with both disease and poison, letting the victim

writhe in pain before succumbing to death.

A nue's ghastly appearance in physical form is only

made eerier by its ability to turn into an inky cloud of

darkness. In this guise, a nue can hide amongst fog clouds

or shadows before emerging as the destructive horror it is.

By the time a nue crawls forth from the inscrutable black

cloud, its prey is often too fatigued from its strange night

terrors to defend itself. The dreams a nue impregnates

creatures' minds with varies from victim to victim, but

all share the trait of an ever-present, foreboding cloud

that exudes a fierce and palpable sense of malice.

Some legends suggest that nues are the spirits of children

warped into twisted forms to spread paranoia, exhaustion,

and fear among former friends and family. According to

these stories, such a cursed child wreaks terror upon its

friends and relatives until they are all either dead or driven

mad by fear. Then, the creature moves on, seeking more

challenging kills to sate its vicious hunger. The greatest joy

a nue can feel is snuffing the life of a oncestrong

and proud target that has been

brought low by its debilitating attacks.

A nue is 9 feet long and

weighs 600 pounds.

Oni

Oni are a race of evil spirits, native to the Material Plane,

that manifest physical bodies based upon the shapes and

desires of humanoid mortals. In pure spirit form, an oni

is nothing but a disembodied evil longing for the sins of

the f lesh. In this form, oni are harmless and invisible. The

majority of these bodiless oni were once kami who failed

their wards, or more often, who deliberately abandoned

them. As punishment, they were stripped of their ability

to form a physical body and then cast into the void. Rarely,

a mortal creature's soul can become a disembodied

oni upon death, or in even rarer cases, after a truly evil

individual has undergone a particularly vile ritual that

ends in suicide. These oni are more often destined for

positions of great power and strength than most.

Eventually, an oni's spirit manifests a physical body

on the Material Plane. The methods by which this may

occur vary, but the process generally takes place in areas

already despoiled by sin, tragedy, or cruelty. The type

of oni a spirit transforms into is inf luenced by a wide

variety of variables, ranging from the nature of what the

oni spirit was before to the location where it is reborn

into the realm of f lesh and blood. Once an oni manifests

its physical body, that body becomes its true form for

the rest of its life-all oni are shapechangers, but this

original form is the form in which they are born and the

form they revert to upon death.

An oni's true form is always similar to that of a specific

type of humanoid, save that it is always deformed and

monstrous to look upon. Tusks, additional eyes, or

strangely colored skin are common physical attributes.

Yet while they have hideous forms, all oni are capable of

changing their shape to assume forms more pleasant to

the civilized eye. The type of shapes an oni can assume

depend upon its species, but all can transform into some

form of humanoid. Oni use this ability to infiltrate

humanoid societies, either to prey upon the weak or to

rule them in disguise.

In order to understand oni, it is important to consider

that most of these beings were once spirits tasked

with protecting a material realm they now believe is

undeserving of such care and concern-indeed, the

physical world is to be dominated and consumed. They

arrive in physical form starved for sensory experience, and

never fully sate their desire to gorge on such experiences.

Most oni seek to attain positions of leadership and power,

often in the guise of a normal humanoid, in order to

secure a never-ending supply of sensory experiences. It is

also important to understand that oni's immoderation is

also motivated by their corrupted and evil natures-that

is, no pleasure is more enjoyable than one that deprives

or wounds another.

Oni retain their hatred of the kami upon reentering

the Material Plane as physical creatures, and often their

depredations and violations of the world can be directly

tied to their efforts to destroy kami or the kami's works.

Oni tend not to congregate with others of their kind,

being most comfortable in positions of leadership over

enslaved or oppressed societies populated by humanoids

they can masquerade as. Yet, at times, particularly

powerful oni abandon this mindset and instead gather to

their side entire legions of oni drawn from all types. The

oni known collectively as the yai-oni with an affinity for

true giants-are most often responsible for such actions,

and when a yai builds such an army of oni, the humanoid

lands shake with terror.

Theoretically, as many types of oni exist as there

are types of humanoids, although in reality, certain

types of oni are much more populous than others. The

ogre mage, an oni associated with ogres, is the bestknown

and most commonly encountered type of oni,

for reasons that still send scholars of oni lore into

spiraling arguments with seemingly no end. Beyond

the oni detailed on the following pages, the atamahuta

(ettins), ja noi (hobgoblins), nogitsune (kitsune), and

wind yai (cloud giants) are relatively well known. Oni

with associations to bugbears, great cyclopes, stone

giants, trolls, troglodytes, and other races exist as well.

And above even the mighty void yai there exist the oni

demigods-entities of nearly incomprehensible power

known as the oni daimyo.

Known Oni Daimyo

Countless oni stalk the world, slaking their greed and

bloodlust to the misery of humanoids. The great leaders

among the oni, beings known as daimyo, are as numerous as

the nations of the world, and all oni seek to climb the rungs

of power to become such powerful entities. The following list

includes oni daimyo that have power in ways that make them

known and feared outside their own domains. Most of these

nefarious oni command armies or control points through

which other oni can enter the world.

Akuma, the Horned King (ogre mage)

Chimon, Hunter of Blood (ogre mage)

Guyuku, the Sea Devil (water oni)

Inma, Empress of the World (void oni)

Muronna, the Dark Mother (ogre mage)

Nataka, the Red King (fire oni)

Onmyuza, Dancer in Flesh (ogre mage)

Ushitora, Keeper of the Oni Gate (void oni)

a cloud of smoke. This functions like gaseous form, except

the cloud has the properties of the smoke cloud from a

pyrotechnics spell (Fort DC 26 negates the effects of the smoke

cloud). The fire yai can end this ability as a standard action.

* See Ultimate Combat.

Fire yai prefer to live in luxury-an orderly and well-built

abode is essential. Even a lone fire yai prefers to build

or inhabit a fortified stone dwelling in its territory, and

surrounds itself with as many luxuries as it can acquire.

Vain, greedy, and brutal, fire yai are the most impulsive of

their kind-several tales tell of clever heroes taunting

fire yai to act rashly. They rarely let challenges pass

uncontested and react quickly to squelch any threat

to their rule.

While many fire yai seek out tribes of fire giants to

infiltrate and rule, not all follow this compulsion. Capable

of assuming the form of many types of humanoid, some

fire yai seek to subtly invade and eventually rule entire

nations of humanoids from within.

A fire yai is 16 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Icy Missile (Su) As a swift action, the ice yai can

fire a dart of ice from its third eye. This dart is a

ranged touch attack (+20 attack bonus), dealing 4d6

points of cold damage on a hit. This attack has a range

of 180 feet with no range increment.

Staggering Strikes (Ex) An ice yai can strike twice per round

with its two slam attacks. A creature struck by

more than two of these slam attacks in a round must make

a DC 28 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The

save DC is Strength-based.

The ice yai is a sinister creature that combines the brutality

of a frost giant with the grace and style of a skilled martial

artist. Although its magical powers are formidable, it

prefers to fight in melee using its slam attacks, leading its

minions in merciless combat. It uses its mobility to cast

combat spells or launch shards of ice from its third eye.

An ice yai is a natural leader among frost giants, tempering

their savagery with its own wisdom. A tribe led by an ice

yai may still raid settlements of neighboring humanoids,

but the tribe soon learns the value of establishing regular

tributes and willing sacrifices-the ice yai teach that

methods that rely upon the threat of violence are often even

more effective than actual violence. Despite this strangely

enlightened philosophy, an ice yai never passes up an

opportunity to reinforce its capacity for slaughter, and will

often demand that its subjects take part in show battles, both

for the entertainment of the tribe and to nurture the ice yai's

insatiable ego and sense of dominion over its subjects.

While the majority of oni tend to be larger than life, and

thus often end up having associations with giants and

other enormous humanoids, not all of them are born into

physical bodies that match their boundless appetites for

cruelty. The kuwa are an example of this, for they are oni

who clothe themselves in human f lesh. While their true

forms remain unmistakably fiendish, with golden skin,

claws, and monstrous visages with short sharp horns,

kuwa are most at home living in disguise among humans.

As with most oni, they generally avoid their own kind,

and instead seek positions of power in human cities, often

as guard captains, guildmasters (particularly of thieves'

guilds), and aristocrats. Most kuwa avoid taking on the

role of a spellcaster unless they possess class levels in an

appropriate class. Likewise, all but the most ambitious

kuwa avoid positions of true authority, such as king or

mayor. Kuwa are most comfortable in the upper echelon of

command, but avoid positions so important that they have

too many eyes on them. To a kuwa, a position of leadership

that doesn't allow frequent abuse of that power is a waste,

and by aiming for less publicly visible positions, the kuwa

increases its opportunities for such abuse.

Once a kuwa secures a position in a human society, the

accumulation of wealth becomes its primary motivation. A

kuwa wants to live a life of decadence and sensual pleasure,

and like any oni, it wants to propagate its own kind. Its

strength and magical powers enable it to easily dominate

normal folk, allowing it to gather groups of thuggish, likeminded

humans to lead in banditry and worse.

A typical kuwa stands about 6 feet in height and weighs

190 pounds.

Mask Symbiosis (Ex) A spirit oni can be worn as a mask

	creature. While worn in

this way, the wearer can see through the oni's eyes and

speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its

own senses and voice. The spirit oni remains a separate

creature, and must detach from its host's face (as a move

action) if it wishes to take any action of its own (including

attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit oni is

worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host's

Perception checks.

Poison (Ex) Gore-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round

for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a

new body of humanoid f lesh, yet this is not the case for

all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to

engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result

is something relatively unusual-an oni made f lesh

directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes

the features of a humanoid as its own.

Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the

Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar.

The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster

to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking

oni mask-this does not require a Craft check or any

additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part

of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the

ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask,

which immediately transforms it into the animate, living

creature presented here.

While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it

also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a

human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered

and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They

must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest

their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them.

When a spirit oni's master dies, the spirit oni gains

free will and the ability to make its own choices-but

the spirit oni's innate cowardice and dishonor usually

prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning

to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni.

Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless

spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their

services to their superiors, in hopes that they might

someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state

to something more bef itting their egos and desires.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Commanding Voice (Su) A void oni gains a +4 racial bonus

on the save DC of any charm or compulsion effects it uses

against humanoids.

Void Form (Su) A void yai may become incorporeal as a swift

action. In this form, it appears as a solid black shadow of its

true form. It gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal

defensive ability while in void form. Any gear or armor the

yai carries becomes incorporeal as well-it loses its AC

bonus from armor and natural armor, but gains a deflection

bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier (+7 for most

void yai, for an AC of 16). It may still speak while incorporeal

and can still use its spell-like and special abilities.

Void Missile (Su) As a swift action, a void yai can launch a

bolt of darkness from its third eye. Damage caused by this

missile is negative energy damage. This attack has a range

of 180 feet with no range increment.

Void Trap (Su) When a void oni uses any teleportation effect

on itself (including its greater teleport and plane shift spelllike

abilities, but not its teleport object spell-like ability), it

can choose to arrive at its destination in void form as a free

action. When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser

sphere of annihilation in a square of its choice that was part

of its space before it teleported. This sphere of annihilation

cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere

itself moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the

closest


	SIZE:T


	or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no

appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not

move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by

a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature

is affected as if by a disintegrate spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once

the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere

vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the

unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

The concept of the void is a difficult one for many individuals

to grasp, for it encompasses more than just an absence

of anything. The concept of "void" as an element also

represents the heavens above, the dark places between

the stars, the nature of the spiritual world, and even the

capacity to create and envision new ideas. The void yai

represents all of these possibilities, interpreted in a way

that exemplifies the evil of the oni race.

Unlike lesser oni, the void yai does not represent any

single humanoid race-the closest it comes is perhaps

the rune giant, and certainly the void yai superficially

resembles monsters of legend, with its dark, heavily

muscled body, horns, and fangs. A void yai manifests

when the combination of an extremely powerful oni spirt

and an overwhelmingly evil location intersect at precisely

the right time. Rarely, an eldritch transformation

spontaneously elevates an existing yai to the vaunted

210

Illustration by Jim Nelson

status of void yai-whispers of vile rituals that an oni can

perform to quicken this transformation keep some sages

awake at night, for if such rituals existed, then all oni

could potentially become void yai-a sobering thought

indeed, given the void yai's daunting capacity for cruelty.

As with almost all oni, the void oni's use of weapons and

armor seems like cruel overkill. A void oni is 20 feet tall

and weighs 10,000 pounds.

Void yai turn toward the Material Plane to satisfy their

desires, lording over lesser creatures with the aid of the

void. A void yai usually claims a huge territory, bringing

much larger creatures to heel as servants. As with fire yai,

a void yai makes frequent use of lesser oni as its minions,

but prefers to surround itself with whatever giant tribe

or society it has conquered. Rarely, a void yai commands

kingdoms of smaller humanoids, but since the immense

void yai has no ability to assume the shape of such small

and insignificant creatures, it often feels awkward and out

of place. More so than other yai, void yai are ashamed of

their true appearance-their vanity is such that most are

masters of using their change shape ability to appear as

breathtakingly handsome or beautiful giants, and it is in

this form they prefer to live. Only when combat begins does

their rage take control, causing them to revert to their true,

horrific shapes.

VOIDLORDS

Between the considerable power of the typical void yai and

the divine might of the oni daimyos exists a middling

category of unique void yai. But to even use the term

"middling" in this context is something of a folly,

for these unique void yai, known collectively as the

voidlords, are among the most powerful creatures

to walk the Material Plane.

While void yai typically content themselves

with ruling nations, voidlords arrive with a

greater mission-to control entire worlds

and bring all that dwell upon these worlds to

their knees. Voidlords are always void yai with

additional racial Hit Dice or class levels-levels

of fighter, monk, and rogue are favorite

choices for voidlords. These powerful

outsiders generally eschew spellcasting

classes under the opinion that might and the oni's inborn

supernatural abilities are a greater path to conquest than

mortal magic. In addition to having the typical void yai

abilities, each voidlord possesses an additional number

of powers keyed to that voidlord's particular area of

focus. Two sample voidlord foci are listed below, but these

represent only a tiny fraction of the total possible.

Martial Arts: A voidlord of martial arts always attacks

with unarmed strikes-it is treated as a 20th-level monk

with the f lurry of blows ability for the purposes of

determining its damage and number of attacks per round

with its unarmed strikes. This voidlord gains Stunning

Fist as a bonus feat, and gains the use of the following

spell-like abilities three times per day: forceful hand,

grasping hand, and greater shout.

Swordplay: A voidlord of sword fighting always carries

a sword of some sort-typically a katana. These voidlords

gain the ability to use the following spell-like abilities

three times per day: blade barrier, keen edge, and mage's sword.

They are automatically proficient in the use of swords, and

any sword they wield is treated

as a +5 weapon, in addition to

any other magical qualities

the weapon might have.

A voidlord of swordplay

can also permanently

transform any magic

weapon (save for

artifacts) into a

sword of any

size or type

by touch.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Acidic Missile (Su) As a swift action, a water yai can

launch a bolt of acid from its third eye. Any creature

struck by this bolt must also make a DC 29 Fortitude

save to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round by the

overwhelming stench of the acid. This attack has a

range of 180 feet with no range increment. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

Flowing Robes (Su) A water yai wears a special silk kimono

infused with magical water. This kimono grants a +6 armor

bonus. These robes function as armor only for water yai.

Liquid Form (Sp) As a standard action, a water yai can turn into a

mobile pool of water. This functions like gaseous form, except

that the yai cannot fly in this form. It retains its own base

speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120 feet. The water yai

can end this ability as a standard action.

The water yai clad themselves in the f lesh of storm giants,

yet these yai are more at home dwelling beneath the

waves than they are above them. Unlike most oni, water

yai have no real longing to rule or infiltrate societies-

yet they still enjoy posing as humanoids. They often

assume the forms of enormous merfolk in the water, but

prefer to adopt the shapes of storm giants when on land.

The water yai then pursues its favorite decadence-the

acclimation of material wealth and

luxuries. Water yai tend to be easily

distracted by beautiful treasures, and

despite their evil natures are prone to

acts of unexpected frivolity.

The noble giant owl roosts in the tallest trees or in high

caves near its forest home. No mere animals, giant owls pride

themselves as intellectuals and keen judges of character.

Little passes a giant owl's notice in its home forest. What

it doesn't observe directly, it learns from its wide network

of animal informants. Giant owls view themselves more as

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Pistols (Su) A pale stranger fights with two pistols. A pistol has

a range increment of 20 feet and deals both bludgeoning

and piercing damage. At a range of up to 20 feet,

a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch

attacks. While pistols normally consume bullets

and black powder when fired, a pale stranger's

pistols supernaturally reload the instant it

fires them, allowing the undead to make

multiple attacks in a round with the weapons.

In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields

functions as a +1 pistol. A pale stranger does not

provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a

pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons

for the purposes of determining penalties from twoweapon

fighting. Further rules for pistols, and firearms in

general, can be found in Ultimate Combat.

Stranger's Luck (Su) A pale stranger gains a +3 luck bonus to

AC and has no chance of misfire when using firearms.

Stranger's Shot (Ex) As a full-round action, a pale stranger can

take careful aim with one of its firearms and take a single,

ruinous shot. This single shot always resolves as a touch

attack, regardless of the actual range. If the pale stranger

threatens a critical hit with this shot, it automatically

confirms the critical hit. Regardless of whether the shot is a

critical hit or not, it deals +6d6 points of damage.

Sometimes death itself cannot come between a gunslinger

and its final revenge. When a gunslinger is slain by a

hated enemy, or murdered before it can achieve vengeance

against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate its

remains as a vengeful undead monstrosity. When a pale

stranger first rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to

finish the job-thereafter, it wanders the desolate parts

of the world looking for new victims to vent its unending

rage upon.

A pale stranger appears much as it did in life, though

desiccated and obviously undead. Rare pale strangers

have the ability to hide their undead nature and appear

as they did in life using veil as a constant spell-like ability

(CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more

powerful and have class levels in gunslinger or ranger,

and often attract large groups of adoring bandits

and followers who may or may not realize that their

murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror.

A pale stranger stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs

130 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Infestation (Ex) Any living creature that takes damage

from a rot grub swarm becomes infested unless

it succeeds at a DC 19 Reflex save. On a failed

save, the infested creature takes 1d4 points of

Constitution damage per round as the rot grubs

burrow through and consume its flesh-this

effect continues as long as the victim remains

in the swarm and continues for 1d6 rounds after it

leaves the swarm. Any energybased

attack (including damage

from negative energy) that

deals at least 5 points of damage

to the victim automatically

destroys all of the rot

grubs infesting it, ending

the effect prematurely.

Additionally, any effect that

removes disease

instantly ends a rot

grub infestation.

Immunity to disease

offers no defense.

The save DC is

Constitutionbased.

Gnaw (Ex) A rot grub that is grappling a foe

and chooses to damage the foe with an

additional grapple check deals twice its

normal bite damage (2d6+6 for most

giant rot grubs), in addition to injecting

an additional dose of poison with each

successful check.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort

Str; cure 1 save.

Rot grubs are foul,

nauseating parasites

that feed on f lesh and use

corpses as nests in which

to grow. While a rot grub can

derive nourishment from dead

f lesh, its true hunger is for the f lesh of the

living. Thankfully, rot grub swarms occur

only rarely, as they require the infested

carcass of a


	SIZE:H


	or larger creature and

many weeks to build up the numbers

necessary to constitute a swarm.

In some cases, a rot grub continues

to feed and grow, eventually reaching

enormous size as a giant rot grub.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Hexes A penanggalen witch can use one of her hexes at will

on any creature within 30 feet. Using a hex is a standard

action (unless otherwise noted) that does not provoke an

attack of opportunity. Save DCs are Intelligence-based.

Cackle Hex (Su) As a move action, the penanggalen may

cackle. Any creature within 30 feet that is under the effects of

the penanggalen's evil eye or misfortune hex has the duration

of that hex extended by 1 round.

Evil Eye Hex (Su) This hex causes the target creature to take

a -2 penalty on one of the following (penanggalen's choice):

AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks.

This effect lasts for 6 rounds, or only 1 round if the target

succeeds at a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Misfortune Hex (Su) This hex causes a creature to suffer

grave misfortune for 1 round. Whenever the target makes an

ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check during

this time, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A DC 15

Will save negates this effect. A creature may only be targeted

by this hex once per day.

The hideous penanggalen is one of the most horrific

vampiric monstrosities. By day, a penanggalen appears

to be a normal humanoid, but at night or when provoked,

the creature's head rips free from the rest of her body,

coils of viscera and entrails dangling from her throat

as she launches into the air, seeking blood to sate her

unholy thirst.

Unlike most undead, the penanggalen is more akin to

the lich in that she willfully abandons both her mortality

and morality to become a hideous undead monster.

While penanggalens are traditionally female spellcasters,

any creature capable of performing the vile ritual of

transformation can become one.

Similar to a lich, a creature works toward becoming a

penanggalen. More than one such transformation ritual

exists, but all require heinous acts that symbolize the

casting aside of kindness, benevolence, and any semblance

of feelings other than cruelty. Many of these rituals call for

the repeated consumption of blood, bile, tears, and other

f luids drawn from captured and tortured innocents.

A penanggalen keeps a vat of vinegar in her lair. When

returning from a night of feeding, a penanggalen's organs

are swollen with blood. In order to fit back into her body,

the penanggalen must soak for 1 hour in this vat of vinegar.

Once reduced, a penanggalen slides back into her body. If a

penanggalen is slain away from her body, the body rapidly

deteriorates into foul-smelling grit.

The penanggalen presented above was a witch in

life. The witch class is presented in full in the Advanced

Player's Guide.

CREATING A PENANGGALEN

"Penanggalen" is an acquired template that can be added

to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to

hereafter as the base creature). Most penanggalens were

once humanoids or 


	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid


	s and nearly

every penanggalen is female. A penanggalen uses the base

creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as base creature +1.

216

Illustration by Kieran Yanner

Alignment: Any evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented).

Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.

Senses: A penanggalen gains darkvision 60 ft.

Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6.

Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s.

All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. As

undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma modifier to

determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).

Defensive Abilities: A penanggalen gains channel

resistance +4, DR 5/silver and slashing, resistance to cold

10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive abilities granted by

the undead type. A penanggalen also gains fast healing 5.

Weaknesses: A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In

addition, a penanggalen is staggered while outside of her

human body and exposed to direct sunlight.

Speed: When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she

retains the same base speed as the base creature. When a

penanggalen is separated from her body, she has only a f ly

speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.

Melee: A penanggalen gains a bite attack and a slam

attack when she is detached from her body. Damage is

standard for attacks of these types for the penanggalen's

size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Special Attacks: A penanggalen retains all of the base

creature's special attacks. She also gains the following

additional special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2

the penanggalen's HD + the penanggalen's Charisma

modifier unless otherwise noted.

Blood Drain (Su): A penanggalen's blood drain special

attack causes 1d4 Constitution damage.

Create Spawn (Su): When a penanggalen slays a female

humanoid via blood drain, and if that slain humanoid had

at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as

a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal is

under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and

remains enslaved until that penanggalen's destruction.

A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling

no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it

creates that would exceed this limit become freewilled

undead.

Disease (Su): Any creature a penanggalen bites

is exposed to filth fever-the save DC against this

disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease

itself.

Wither (Su): A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul

bile that blisters and weakens living f lesh. Any creature

that is damaged by a penanggalen's slam attack must

succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4

Charisma damage.

Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an

undead creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score.

Skills: A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff,

Fly, Knowledge (arcana), Perception, Sense Motive, and

Stealth checks.

Special Qualities: A penanggalen gains the following

special quality.

Separate (Su): During the day, a penanggalen has the

same appearance as she did in life, and does not detect

as undead (though she is still an undead creature). At

night, she can detach her head and entrails as a fullround

action. Her physical but now hollow body exists

as dead f lesh, but can be destroyed if it suffers damage

equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point total. Before

a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her

entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to

her body, at which point any damage done to the body

immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen

herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is

destroyed can never again walk the day in living form,

but is otherwise unharmed (save for no longer having a

safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a penanggalen

wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her f ly

speed, or any of her special penanggalen attacks.

Flame Jump (Sp) A peri can enter any fire equal to the peri's

This ability otherwise functions as greater teleport (caster

50 pounds of objects.

Smoke Sight (Su) A peri can see through fire, fog, and smoke

without penalty.

Whirlwind Dance (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a

peri can spin in an ever-faster, whirling dance, transforming

itself into a spinning vortex of flame 10 to 40 feet high

for up to 9 rounds. This ability functions as the whirlwind

ability (DC 26 Reflex save), but any creature that comes in

contact with the whirlwind or is caught inside it takes 2d6+6

points of fire damage and is subject to the peri's burn

special attack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Peris are a race of celestials native to the good-aligned

Outer Planes, but they are also often found in the

company of mortals on the Material Plane. Believed to

be the descendants of fallen angels, peris do penance

for their ancestors' sins before they can earn a place in

paradise. As a result, peris work tirelessly to aid and

support good heroes of the mortal realms in a neverending

battle against evil.

Peris hate the evil fiends known as divs, who constantly

seek to ruin the good works of mortals. Peris often work

to repair damage wrought by the destructive divs. For

their part, the divs take great pleasure in tormenting and

persecuting peris, locking the fiery-winged celestials in

cages of cold iron and endlessly torturing them.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Phantom Flesh (Su) As a move action, a phantom fungus

can turn invisible as if using greater invisibility (caster

level 4th). A moment after it attacks with invisibility,

the creature appears briefly as a semitransparent

version of its normal

self. This allows any viewer with

line of sight to the phantom fungus to

pinpoint its location at the time of the attack

(though if the creature moves after it attacks,

opponents have to pinpoint it again). An

opponent can ready an action to strike at the

fungus when it momentarily appears, in which

case the creature only has concealment instead

of invisibility (20% miss chance). The fungus can

turn completely visible as a move action, though it

normally remains invisible all the time. If killed while

invisible, it becomes visible 1d4 minutes later.

A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant

that roams the vast and deep underground caverns

of the world. It wanders in search of food,

using its rootlike feet to detect movement

along the cavern f loors and the sensitive tendrils

surrounding its mouth to pinpoint prey.

A phantom fungus's primary advantage as a predator

is its ability to vanish from sight. Stealthily patrolling

the perimeters of caverns, a phantom fungus remains

invisible until it is behind its prey, at which point it snaps

at its victim with its vicious maw.

A phantom fungus prefers to ambush lone creatures.

When it encounters a larger group, a phantom fungus

often stalks prey for hours, waiting for the targets to spread

out or make camp so that it may attack a single foe at its

leisure. Though phantom fungi are not normally pack

hunters, there are reports of groves working together to

bring down larger foes. When faced with no other option

than to attack multiple foes, a group of phantom fungi

focuses its attacks on single targets. They prefer to attack

noisier foes if possible-characters wearing heavy armor

or those that make heavy use of loud attacks (such as bards

or spellcasters) are preferred over quieter creatures.

The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey

is lined with row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that

resemble pointed rocks more than actual fangs. This

"mouth" is not used to feed, however, and does not attach

to a digestive tract-it is nothing more than a gaping

natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does

so by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse

with thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through

dead f lesh to siphon away nutrients.

A typical phantom fungus is 6 feet tall and weighs 200

pounds. Although they prefer dwelling underground,

they have been encountered above ground as well.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Magnetic Pulse (Su)

A plasma ooze is

surrounded by an

aura of magnetism

that allows it to attract

metallic objects and

creatures. At the start

of the ooze's turn as

a free action, the ooze

makes a combat maneuver

check against all metallic

creatures, all creatures wearing

metal armor, and all creatures

wielding metal weapons within

30 feet. If it beats the CMD of a

metal or armored creature with this check, that creature is

pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze and cannot move away from

the ooze for 1 round. If this causes the creature to move into

a square occupied by the plasma ooze, the ooze can attempt

to engulf that creature as a free action. If it beats the CMD of

a creature wielding a metal weapon, that weapon is disarmed

and pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze. Unattended metal

objects of size


	SIZE:L


	or smaller are automatically pulled

toward a plasma ooze. This magnetism is supernatural in

nature and affects all metal objects.

Plasma Ray (Su) As a standard action, a plasma ooze can fire

1d4 plasma rays at up to 4 separate targets within 60 feet

(no more than one ray can attack a single creature). Each ray

deals 4d6 points of electricity damage and 4d6 points of fire

damage on a hit.

Massive and devastating, plasma oozes are mysterious,

extraterrestrial beings made of superheated electromagnetic

sludge. While their origin is not fully known, it is widely

accepted that plasma oozes are not from this world.

Some scholars believe they dwell in the sun, while others

maintain they hail from the Plane of Fire. That plasma

oozes have been encountered in both of these locations

does little to help solve the debate.

A plasma ooze f lies by somehow interacting

with gravity and magnetic waves,

drifting through the air in a manner

similar to the way a jellyfish swims

in water. This creature's only real

purpose is to consume, and it prefers

to do so by drawing prey into

its fiery, electrified core.

Scholars find it curious

that while a plasma ooze

can only attract and repel

metallic substances, the thing

can only digest organic matter,

and rather slowly at that.

Survivors of plasma

ooze attacks are rare,

but such victims

describe the pain of

being struck by one's

rays as like being

pulled apart piece by

piece. Wounds left by a

plasma ooze's touch

resemble hideously

melted burn scars.

A plasma ooze is

20 feet in diameter

and weighs 6,000

pounds.

Change Shape (Su) A popobala loses its frightful

presence, popobala fever, and stench abilities

when not in its true form.

Harvester of Sorrow (Su) A popobala heals as a

result of the suffering of others. It gains

fast healing 10 if at least one creature

within 15 feet has one or more of the following conditions:

confused, cowering, dying, exhausted, fatigued, frightened,

nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.

Horrid Haunting (Su) A popobala may use ghost sound or

ventriloquism as a free action whenever it manipulates a

creature or object with animate objects, dominate person, or

telekinesis. The ghost sound or ventriloquism originates from

the controlled object or creature.

Popobala Fever (Su) A creature wounded by a popobala's

talons becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes unless it makes

a DC 25 Fortitude save. A creature already sickened by the

fever becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds. One already

nauseated by the fever is helpless for 1d6 rounds. This is a

disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The popobala is a much-feared shapeshifter that haunts

and hunts warm coastal lands, roaming night and day to

terrorize and spread anarchy and unrest while slaking its

insatiable twin urges for violence and prurience. Shifting

freely between bat, human, and its natural form, the

popobala is most dreaded for its mesmeric charms, but it

is more than capable of engaging in savage bloodletting

against those who anger it. Popobalas are attracted to

chaos, anarchy, and unrest, as the intensity of emotions

and uncertainty inf lames its already fierce urges. War,

changes of government, and religious or ethnic strife

or persecution-all of these excite a popobala, and if a

society remains too settled and stable, the beast is never

above fomenting unrest through its own predations.

A typical popobala is 5 feet tall with a 12 foot wingspan.

It weighs only 100 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Spawn Undead (Su) Any creature slain by a pukwudgie's

poisonous quills rises in 24 hours as a zombie. Undead

created by this ability are not immediately under the control

of a pukwudgie, but they receive a -4 penalty on saves

against a pukwudgie's control undead spell-like ability.

Poison (Su) Quill-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round

for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Quills (Ex) A pukwudgie can fire two of its quills as a ranged

attack as a standard action. These quills have a range

increment of 40 feet. Any creature attacking a pukwudgie

with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons,

or an unarmed strike takes 1d3 points of piercing damage.

A creature that grapples a pukwudgie takes 2d4 points of

piercing damage. Anyone who takes damage from these

quills is also exposed to the pukwudgie's poison.

The vile pukwudgie is a small, hunchbacked humanoid

covered with long, sharp quills. These quills, like those

of a porcupine, help protect the small creature but are

also dangerous offensive weapons, for the quills hold

a deadly poison that animates those it slays as zombies.

This necromantic nature, along with their penchant for

torment and sadistic ways, makes pukwudgies evil to the

core. A pukwudgie stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs a

little more than 30 pounds.

Pukwudgies are frequently found in the company

of undead. This retinue usually

consists of zombies and skeletons

created via their poisonous quills

ability or their ability to animate

dead bodies. They have a strong

preference for animating the

bodies of dead animals over

other creatures, and often use

undead animals as mounts.

A pukwudgie usually stays away

from well-traveled areas and

humanoid settlements, but

may sometimes slip into

small villages in the night

to steal children. The little

horrors enjoy the tender

f lesh of newborn babies

immensely, and are often

willing to go through great

personal risk to secure

infantile repasts when they

are available. Their delight

in arson only further

makes them a bane of

small villages.

Rakshasa

Rakshasas are born on the Material Plane, but they are

not of it. They possess the powers and shapes of fiends,

but their fates are inexorably tied to the mortal world, and

it is there that they seek to rule. The reincarnations of

manipulators, traitors, and tyrants obsessed with earthly

pleasures, rakshasas are the embodiments of the very

nature of materialistic evil. After dying violent deaths,

these spirits are so tied to worldly decadence and selfish

concerns that they take shapes that better ref lect the

baseness of their lives and are reborn as fiends. Thus have

sages come to know these beings as the "earthbound evils."

While there are many different types of rakshasas, from

the lowly raktavarna to the powerful maharaja, the most

commonly encountered members of this race (the rakshasas

presented in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) are not known

by any other name-they are more powerful than some

members of their kind and less powerful than others, and

represent the ideal midpoint between servitor and master.

These rakshasas can be recognized by their animal heads

(those of great cats, snakes, crocodiles, apes, and birds of

prey being the most common) and backward-facing hands.

Feral traits and strangely reversed joints are a hallmark of

all types of rakshasas, in fact, features that most rakshasas

can hide through their supernatural ability to change

shapes or by means of powerful illusions.

A rakshasa cannot impregnate another of its own kind,

and so new rakshasas come into being via the coupling

of a rakshasa and a non-rakshasa or, rarely, that of two

non-rakshasas. A rakshasa born to non-rakshasa parents

generally only occurs when one or both of the parents

commits a great evil during the mother's pregnancy,

allowing the disembodied spirit of a previously slain

rakshasa to reincarnate into the world by usurping the

unborn offspring's body. Rarely, such blasphemous births

aff lict good or innocent parents, typically in cases where

the parents are exposed to great evils beyond their control.

A rakshasa grows to maturity more quickly than a human,

and often functions as a full-grown adult earlier than age

14. Despite this quick maturation, a rakshasa can live for

500 years or more before dying, at which point its spirit

seeks a new host to be reborn in, continuing the vile cycle

of fiendish reincarnation over and over again.

Rakshasas believe that each and every creature in

the universe has a proper role to play, and that success

comes from understanding one's position and working

to improve it. Rakshasas don't see castes as good or evil,

but rather as purely pragmatic. Creatures of higher caste

should be respected for their great power, and those of

lower caste should be pressed into willing service to

expand the holdings of those of higher castes as their

betters seek greater wealth and inf luence.

There are seven castes in rakshasa society (from

lowest to greatest): pagala (traitors), goshta (food), adhura

(novices), darshaka (servants), paradeshi (rakshasa-kin),

hakima (lords), and samrata (lords of lords). The rakshasa

caste system encompasses not just all of rakshasa society,

but all of life-although only rakshasas can attain the

stations of darshaka and above.

While rakshasas are forced to admit that the gods have

powers greater than their own, most rakshasas scoff at

the concept of divinity as a whole. The gods are among

the most powerful beings in existence, to be sure, but too

many examples of powerful, ambitious, or merely lucky

mortals attaining divinity exist for rakshasas to pay

religious homage to such creatures. Rakshasas see their

own transitions from mortals to otherworldly beings as

marks of their own fathomless potential and their initial

steps on the path to godhood. Thus, as a race, rakshasas

deny the worship of deities, although they welcome

alliances with the servants of such peerlessly potent

beings when it serves their purposes.

The skin of a rakshasa is remarkably resistant to

physical damage, able to ignore or greatly reduce most

weapon attacks. Holy weapons capable of piercing this

skin, however, can reach a rakshasa's vitals and do

significant damage. As a result, in lands where their kind

are well known, rakshasas take great pains to disguise

themselves with magic when they are among enemies.

Rakshasa Immortals

The rakshasa immortals are rakshasas who have ascended

beyond mortality-they are no longer bound to the cycle of

reincarnation and rebirth most rakshasas endure, and are truly

immortal. Such creatures, given the span of countless lifetimes

to perfect their art and master their cruelties, approach the

power of gods. The following list includes several (but by no

means all) rakshasa immortals known to the world. Among

them, Ravana is the greatest and most ancient.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Spells A dandasuka casts arcane spells as a 2nd-level sorcerer.

Dandasukas, also known as "biters" among rakshasas,

serve as spies and assassins. They often appear as part of

a rakshasa's retinue or secret network. Born to manipulate

and murder, they revel in their work and delight in the sight

of blood. Thus, dandasukas go about their work cheerfully,

laughing as they manipulate foes and butcher victims.

All dandasukas are restless and energetic. They crave

activity and entertainment, preferring the sick and

cruel to conventional fare. Dandasuka pranks are rarely

amusing for the victim.

Monstrous hunger gnaws at the hyperactive dandasuka's

body, making the creature crave humanoid f lesh and

blood. When such blood is spilled, a dandasuka is often

not able to contain its fiendish appetite. It might lick a

bloody blade, lap up fallen drops, or even take a bite out of

a fallen foe at the expense of a more tactically sound option

in a fight. A dandasuka settles for other meat when it must,

but it always prefers humanoid f lesh.

Murder and mayhem are not the only duties of a

dandasuka. Stronger rakshasas dispatch dandasukas

as emissaries and servants to allies. Despite their usual

disorderly habits, they bargain good-naturedly and in good

faith, only implying dire consequences for noncompliance.

Dandasuka negotiators efficiently take care of impasses if

no favorable resolution can be reached. Similarly, dandasuka

retainers serving rakshasa allies curb their fiendish ways as

best they can, though their employers would still do well to

keep them amused and fed. One has to be careful of keeping

dandasukas too pleased, however, since they are known to

take unwanted initiative because of off-hand remarks, such

as idle wishes that a certain person were dead.

Dandasuka greed extends from amusements and food to

wealth. All dandasukas love comfort, fine clothing, and shiny

baubles. Most of them wear as much jewelry as they possibly

can without looking ridiculous, and some cross that line. A

dandasuka is 3 feet tall and weighs 55 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Extra Initiative (Su) When an encounter starts, a maharaja

rolls twice for initiative. The maharaja acts normally on

the higher of the two initiative counts each round. On

the lower initiative count, the maharaja can take a single

standard action.

Spells A maharaja casts arcane spells as an 18th-level sorcerer.

All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for

whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a

birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the

maharajas-those rakshasas whose depredations and

acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their

kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments

of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the

beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference

of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within

the rakshasa race that few can: fear.

A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa

of great power and inf luence has spent several lives as

a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's

social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends

to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with

rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young

maharaja-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth

of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The

maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a lasting

nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine

ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer

its domain, often splitting the region into large enough

chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still

have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more

than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century.

So great is a maharaja's power and inf luence and so

long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying

the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating

armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can

often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its

servitors-often charmed or dominated humanoids,

or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned

outsiders-lounging in opulence.

The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent

mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree

decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with

226

Illustration by Eva Widermann

rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather

than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with

exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer

creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the

trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of

defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the

heads of failed lieutenants.

A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does

not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal

servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling

adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's

rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to

ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and

illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats.

Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control,

most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and

lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly.

RAKSHASA RAJADHIRAJAS

Each maharaja is unique, the process of its evolution

granting it strengths and weaknesses that differentiate

the being from all before it. Over its lifetimes, its path

teaches it myriad lessons and grants distinctive powers. A

typical maharaja is a master of divination, enchantment,

and illusion. Other maharajas master various other

techniques, such as necromancy or conjuration. As a

maharaja continues to grow in malignant might, its

powers outstrip those even of its peers. It might ultimately

ascend to the rank of rajadhiraja-a king of kings.

Even more so than the maharajas, the rajadhirajas

are unique beings. A rajadhiraja is never lower

than


	CR:21-most have additional racial Hit

Dice beyond the standard maharaja. Each

additional racial Hit Die granted increases the

rakshasa's


	CR:by +1, but also increases its effective sorcerer

caster level by +1 and grants a new spell-like ability that

follows that rakshasa's personal theme and philosophy. A

rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time

might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per

day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees

itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use

shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of

combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like

abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa

gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells

should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells

usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level

at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as

you see fit to make a more interesting rajadhiraja.

The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories

it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power

to manipulate life and death according to this cycle.

A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to

alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all

rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition

to their other powers.

Reincarnate (Su): Once per day as a standard action,

a rajadhiraja can bring a dead creature back to life as if

using the reincarnate spell, except that the target must

have been dead less than 1 day and can have been killed

by a death effect. As with any effect that restores life to a

creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be

reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to

happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via

true resurrection in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their

own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to

allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The

new form granted by this effect can be any form within

one size category of the dead creature's original size-the

exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja.

Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate

spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical

ability score adjustments.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Confusion (Su) A creature bitten by a marai's bite (from

either its actual mouth or the snakes it has for hands) must

succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become confused for 1

round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Energy Bolts (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action

that provokes an attack of opportunity, a marai's six snake

arms can each spit a bolt of energy to a maximum range

of 60 feet. Each bolt deals 1d8 points of damage and has

an additional effect if the target fails to resist it with a DC

19 Fortitude save, as summarized below. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Amethyst Viper: Cold damage plus sickened for 1d4 rounds.

Crimson Viper: Fire damage plus burn (1d4, DC 19).

Emerald Viper: Acid damage plus nauseated for 1 round.

Magenta Viper: Electricity damage plus staggered for 1 round.

Turquoise Viper: Sonic damage plus stunned for 1 round.

Violet Viper: Force damage plus knocked prone.

Spells A marai casts arcane spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.

Marai are deviant spellcasters first and fiendish corruptors

second. If allowed to indulge in their desire for perverse

mystical study, most marai are content to serve as part

of another rakshasa's cabal. A solitary marai might pose

as a neophyte magician to infiltrate another spellcaster's

abode. If the marai is successful, the master soon becomes

either the servant or a corpse.

The possibility of new magical discoveries drives a

marai. Morality and compassion never constrain the

fiend's experiments. A marai prefers to torment and

exploit mortals who have no idea of the rakshasa's true

nature, and it takes great pleasure in using magical might

to bring would-be heroes,

especially those who

invade its lair, to their

knees. Such a game

offers a marai enjoyment,

however, only if subjects are unaware of the

danger or at least unable to oppose it.

A marai is 6 feet tall and weighs 160

pounds. Its serpentine arms render fine

manipulation or wielding weapons unfeasible,

and so it typically assumes humanoid form when

working on experiments that require manual dexterity. A

marai unable to do so must rely upon cantrips like

mage hand for such tasks-or perhaps

the aid of a slave or charmed ally.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Change Shape (Su) As a full-round action, a raktavarna can

take the shape of a handheld object, most often an

ornamental light, a one-handed weapon, or a piece

of treasure. If the rakshasa remains stationary

in such a form, it can attempt Stealth checks

even while being observed. It can remain

motionless in object form indefinitely, but

reverts to its true form as soon as it takes

any action.

Master's Eyes (Su) A raktavarna can

designate a single creature as its master

as a standard action. If the raktavarna

is a spellcaster's familiar, its master is

automatically that spellcaster, and the

raktavarna cannot change this. As a fullround

action, a raktavarna's master can observe

the world as if looking through the raktavarna's eyes. The

master must concentrate to maintain this link each round.

The master's visual senses are suppressed for this time, and

he uses the raktavarna's darkvision, detect magic, and regular

eyesight to observe the world. This ability has no limit on

range, and functions even across planar boundaries. If the

raktavarna is slain while its master is using this ability, the

master is stunned for 1d4 rounds (no save).

Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round

for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Wis plus modify memory; cure 1 save.

Each time a victim takes Wisdom damage from this poison, a

modify memory effect causes the victim to forget the previous

minute's interactions with the raktavarna, as long as the

raktavarna is no longer visible or is in object form. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Made up of smoke, blood, and gold, raktavarnas are the

least of the rakshasas-they are born not from humanoids,

but from the souls of rakshasas who failed utterly in their

previous incarnation and who are thus reborn from a

serpent's egg.

These terrors drift through society, passing from hand

to hand as weapons or strange tokens from foreign lands,

curiosities brought home by traders and emissaries and

given to leaders as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas

gain entry into corridors of power throughout the world,

and what they see, their foul masters know. A raktavarna's

servitude to a master ends only when its master decrees,

or (more commonly) upon the master's death. Little

disconcerts raktavarnas more than having no master,

and when they are cast adrift in this manner, they seek a

replacement as soon as they can.

A 7th-level lawful evil spellcaster with

the Improved Familiar feat can gain a

raktavarna rakshasa as a familiar.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Martial Artist (Su) A tataka's unarmed strikes deal 2d6 points

of damage. If a tataka gains monk levels, it uses its tataka

unarmed strike damage or its monk unarmed strike damage,

whichever is higher. Its unarmed strikes function as lawful

and evil weapons for overcoming damage reduction.

Spells A tataka casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. A tataka

can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally

available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane

spells for a tataka.

Tataka rakshasas are the least subtle and largest of their

kind. They are philosophers and fanatics, loyal servants of

the rakshasa immortals. Their familiarity with religion

and its trappings makes them excellent corruptors and

blasphemers. Such rakshasas might assault sacred sites

or rituals directly so as to foil good works and slay holy

people. A tataka holds all religions in contempt save the

worship of rakshasas, and it openly mocks and assaults

any who dare believe otherwise.

Tataka rakshasas are more than zealots, though, and

they train from an early age in martial arts-their strikes

can break bones as surely as any unarmed strike from

a monk or other practitioner of such

styles of combat.

A typical tataka is 12 feet tall and

weighs 1,300 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Swarming (Ex) Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally,

and are adept at swarming foes for their own gain and their

foes' detriment. Up to two ratfolk can share the same square at

the same time. If two ratfolk in the same square attack

the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that

foe as if they were in two opposite squares.

Ratfolk are small, rodentlike humanoids

often found traveling in nomadic trading

caravans or perhaps dwelling in colonies

in slums, sewers, and other normally

undesirable urban sectors. Tinkerers

and hoarders by nature, many ratfolk

are shrewd merchants, carefully

navigating the shifting alliances

of black markets and bazaars.

They love their stockpiles of

interesting items far more

than money, and would rather trade for more baubles to

add to their hoards than for mere coins.

Ratfolk are extremely communal, and live in large

warrens with plenty of hidden crannies in which to stash

their hoards or f lee in times of danger, gravitating toward

subterranean tunnels or tightly packed tenements in

city ghettos. They feel an intense bond with their large

families and kin networks, as well as with ordinary

rodents of all sorts, living in chaotic harmony and

fighting fiercely to defend each other when threatened.

Ratfolk are generally 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. They

often wear robes to conceal their forms in cities, as they know

other humanoids find their rodent features distasteful.

RATFOLK CHARACTERS

Ratfolk are defined by their class levels-they do not possess

racial Hit Dice. All ratfolk have the following racial traits.

-2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence: Ratfolk are

agile and clever, yet physically weak.

Small: Ratfolk are


	SIZE:S


	and gain a +1 size bonus to their

AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on CMB

and to CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.

Darkvision: Ratfolk can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Tinker: Ratfolk gain a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy),

Perception, and Use Magic Device checks.

Rodent Empathy: Ratfolk gain a +4 bonus on Handle

Animal checks made to inf luence rodents.

Swarming: See above.

Languages: Ratfolk begin play speaking Common.

Ratfolk with high intelligence can choose from any of

the following bonus languages: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven,

Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Orc, and Undercommon.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Beckoning Call (Su) As a standard action, a rusalka can sing

or speak, causing all non-fey creatures within a 300-foot

spread to approach its position as if compelled to do so

via a suggestion spell (DC 27 Will negates). A creature that

successfully saves is not subject to the same rusalka's

beckoning call for 24 hours. When an affected creature begins

its turn adjacent to the rusalka, it is dazed for that round.

These effects continue as long as the rusalka takes a standard

action to maintain the effect, plus 1 additional round. This is

a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Staggering Touch (Su) A creature touched by a rusalka must

make a DC 27 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by

overwhelming feelings of desire and shame. This is a mindaffecting

effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Tresses (Su) A rusalka's long hair is strong and capable of

making powerful primary natural attacks. When it uses its

tresses to grapple an opponent, a rusalka does not gain

the grappled condition itself. In addition, a rusalka uses its

Charisma modifier in addition to its Strength modifier for all

combat maneuver checks made with its tresses.

Rusalkas are cruel and bitter fey who inhabit waterways near

humanoid settlements. Although rusalkas are not undead,

some persist in believing that these fey form from the

spirits of those who met a sinister end in the water. Rusalkas

do little to dissuade such rumors. Rusalkas are fond of

keeping a few charmed monsters or powerful humanoids

nearby to aid in their defense or for other forms of cruel

and humiliating entertainment, but quickly grow bored

with such pets. When this occurs, rusalkas generally

murder the creatures and seek more interesting

replacement pets.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Dust Cloud (Ex) A sabosan gains Hover

as a bonus feat, and can use this feat to

create a dust cloud even though it is not

Large. The resulting dust cloud has only a

30-foot radius.

Fell Shriek (Su) As a standard action, a

sabosan can emit a deafening cry in a

30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must

make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save

or be deafened for 1 minute. Sabosan are

immune to this ability. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Sabosan are an intelligent and evil race

of batlike humanoids that dwell in warm

and isolated forests or deep underground in

vast caverns.

Sabosan are vicious predators, combining human

intelligence with a bat's natural adaptations for hunting.

They favor warm climates, preferring to make their lairs

in places that are inaccessible to most intruders, such

as mountaintop crags, abandoned ruins, subterranean

caverns near hidden hot springs, and dense canopies of

jungle trees. With wingspans almost three times their

height, sabosan are agile and graceful f liers, capable

of traveling miles on a single current of air in their

dauntless search for prey.

Although they can see as well as any human in

daylight, sabosan hunt at twilight or after dark when

their echolocation-based blindsense ability gives them

a great advantage. Sabosan can also use their voices

offensively, funneling their screeches into blasts of highpitched

sound capable of deafening other creatures.

When hunting en masse or attacking foes, a sabosan

employs its fell shriek on adversaries while other sabosan

use their massive wings to churn up great clouds of dust

and debris, rendering foes deaf and blind.

A sabosan's emaciated frame belies its strength and

agility, which are not apparent from its gaunt appearance.

Its giant, leathery wings can reach a span of almost 20

feet. Both males and females have red or dark brown fur

on their heads, necks, chests, and backs. Sabosan

stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh only

150 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Baleful Whinny (Su) As a standard action, a sagari can emit

a monstrous whinny. Any creature within 60 feet must

succeed at a DC 12 Will save or become sickened for

1d4 rounds by the hideous sound. This is a sonic, mindaffecting

effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the

affected creature is immune to the same sagari's baleful

whinny for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Flight (Su) A sagari's flight is supernatural in nature.

Lashing Strike (Ex) Although a sagari is Tiny, it does not

provoke attacks of opportunity when it makes melee

attacks. In addition, its tentacle attack is a primary attack.

Sagaris haunt forest trails, hanging upside-down from

tree branches by the grotesque tentacles that make

up their necks. Unexpectedly intelligent, these cruel

aberrations swoop down from their perches to attack

unsuspecting travelers wandering through the forests.

Their piercing whinny causes sickness within those

who hear it, the sound waves reverberating within the

victims' chests and causing them to feel unwell. Groups

of sagaris are particularly dangerous, filling the air with

their terrifying neighs and diving upon utterly helpless,

nauseated victims in a rush.

The tentacle of a sagari is not strong enough to grab

or strangle enemies, but serves the creature well as an

additional attack to augment its bite. Sagaris are strictly

carnivorous, and while they resort to feeding on carrion

if necessary, they greatly prefer fresh meat. When a sagari

makes its way into a settlement either to wreak havoc or

by accident, it can be found hanging from the rafters of a

barn or some other structure with a tall ceiling. Stabled

livestock are ideal prey for sagaris, who can swiftly kill

and devour the f lesh of a trapped animal in minutes. A

sagari will not attack a creature that it suspects is much

stronger, though it will sometimes assault groups of

creatures, hoping to sicken enough of its foes to distract

them while it attacks the weakest individual.

Sagaris are thought to have originally come from the

vast caverns beneath the world's surface. While sagaris

can speak, they rarely do so with those they deem prey,

seeing little point in communicating with food. Despite

their relative intelligence, sagaris rarely form societies of

any nature, at most traveling in roving packs in search of

larger prey to take down as a group.

A sagari is 3 feet long from mouth to tentacle and

weighs 30 pounds.

foes, and has a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks

rather than the normal +4 bonus most creatures with

grab possess.

Mirage (Su) A sargassum fiend emits a powerful

scent that causes specific, miragelike

hallucinations. All creatures within 300 feet of a

sargassum fiend must make a DC 18 Will save or

become enraptured by the scent. An enraptured

creature sees the monster as whatever would

most compel it to approach. This might be

a lost loved one, a child in need of help,

an enchanting mermaid, the promise of

dry land, and so on. The extent of this

illusion functions as mirage arcana (CL

equals the sargassum's CR), but is a mindaffecting

phantasm, not a glamer. This effect

ends immediately if the plant makes an attack against any

target. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A sargassum fiend is a free-f loating mass of intelligent

seaweed capable of luring its victims to their deaths via a

powerful hallucinogenic pheromone. Once the sargassum

fiend lures prey within striking distance, it grabs the

entranced creature and attempts to crush it to death.

Experienced sailors tell tales of entire crews jumping

overboard to swim out to a murderous field of the sea plants.

The strange pheromone produced by a sargassum fiend

can be harvested from the numerous bulbs that grow within

the fiend's body, but these bulbs rot quickly once harvested.

A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming useless; until

that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce

a mirage effect as detailed above. A single sargassum fiend

generally has 1d6 bulbs of musk when slain-harvesting

one requires a DC 29 Survival check. To date, no alchemical

or magical process has successfully preserved this musk.

Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet

in diameter before splitting, their means of asexual

reproduction. Mutations have been known to exist,

however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual

sargassum fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size,

up to Colossal. Such enormous sargassum fiends can be

created by advancing their Hit Dice by a minimum of 5 HD

per size increase step.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Pungency (Ex) A sasquatch's odor is quite powerful, and can be

detected at twice the normal distance by scent.

Woodland Stride (Ex) A sasquatch can move through any

sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,

overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at normal speed and

without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.

Undergrowth that has been magically manipulated to

impede movement still affects the sasquatch.

The elusive sasquatches earn their

mysterious reputation rightly;

they live in unpopulated forests

and avoid confrontations with

humanoids, only becoming violent

when they feel threatened, when their

territory is encroached upon, or when they

feel they must protect their young. Left to

their own devices, sasquatch families are

perfectly content to live their lives in the deep

woods, leaving behind little to no trace of their passing save

for the periodic big footprint in the ground.

Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are

incredibly stealthy creatures, capable of moving through

forests in particular with astonishing grace and efficiency.

The one trait that somewhat undermines sasquatches'

stealth is their distinctive odor-a pungent, musky scent

that is often noticeable even when the hidden sasquatches

themselves are not apparent.

The elusiveness of sasquatches is such that even in a

world where dragons and sea monsters are real, many

urban scholars doubt the existence of the creatures, citing

the lack of evidence of sasquatch lairs or remains as proof

of their nonexistence. In truth, sasquatches are simply far

more efficient at living in harmony with nature than most

humanoids could ever hope to be. To a sasquatch, a deadfall

in a forest makes a perfectly fine home. When a sasquatch

dies, its kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide all

trace of the gravesite to protect the remains from scavengers

and evil spirits alike. The sasquatch tongue is a relatively

complex language that mixes vocalizations, howls, and

"knocking"-the act of striking a solid surface (like a tree

or boulder) with a club or stone-and thus tends to blend in

with the ambient sounds of a forest.

A sasquatch is 8 feet tall and weighs 570 pounds. Rural

populaces often have fond nicknames for these creatures,

such as wild men, skunk apes, and perhaps most popularly,

simply bigfoot.

round, a deadfall scorpion may act as if it had a full

round to act, rather than just one standard action.

The enormous deadfall scorpion is disturbingly

stealthy for a creature of its size. So named for

the creatures' habit of making their lairs

amid the hollows created by deadfalls of

old trees, deadfall scorpions adorn their

already camouf laged carapaces

with moss and old branches, then

lie in wait to ambush prey when it

draws near. They prefer to drag

their prey back to their hidden

deadfall lairs to eat, and

thus incidental treasure can

often be found within such

a den. A deadfall scorpion is

24 feet long and weighs

10,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Anchored (Ex) As a full-round action, a giant sea anemone can

affix itself to a solid surface. While anchored, it cannot move,

and it gains a +4 bonus to its CMD on all checks to resist being

bull-rushed, dragged, overrun, or repositioned. This bonus

increases by +4 for each size category larger the sea anemone

is compared to the opponent attempting the maneuver. The

creature can unanchor itself as a full-round action.

Poison (Ex) Tentacle-

injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency

1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex damage; cure

2 consecutive saves.

Sightless (Ex) A sea anemone is blind and

is not affected by any effect that relies on

sight, such as gaze attacks or blindness.

Giant sea anemones are beautiful but

deadly ocean-dwelling vermin that rely on

camouf lage and paralytic toxins to draw

in their prey. A sea anemone has a

long, cylindrical body that ends in

a f lat circular disc with a slitlike

orifice for both ingesting food

and dispelling waste. This disc is

surrounded by a thicket of tendrils that vary in thickness

from fine, hairlike cilia to thick, swollen appendages. The

creature uses all of these tentacles at once when it attacks

prey. Like their smaller kin, giant sea anemones come in

a broad spectrum of colors-many are known for their

brilliant hues.

Giant sea anemones can move at a slow pace by walking

along the projections at their bases. More often, however,

these predators affix themselves to rock, coral, or sunken

objects like ships, then wait for prey to come to them.

As mindless creatures, giant sea anemones have no use

for treasure, but the remains of prey digested and then

expelled often litter the area around these creatures.

Massive sea anemones big enough to eat dolphins, whales,

or even sea serpents reportedly exist in the deepest parts of

the ocean. Called deep tigers for their alternating fronds

of black and brilliant orange, these giant sea anemones

are said to lair in undersea ruins and sunken ships, where

the promise of sought-after treasure conveniently lures in

a constant food supply.

Other species of sea anemones exist as well, some smaller

but most quite a bit larger and favoring different oceanic

regions and depths. You can adjust the stats for the giant

sea anemone by changing the Hit Dice and size (adjusting

Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to

represent a wide range of species. Often, different species

have additional abilities, such as the darkforest anemone's

constriction attack, or the deep tiger's ability to squirt

acid. The following table lists the most common variants.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Dooming Gaze (Su) Paralyzed with fear for 1 round,

60 feet, Will DC 27 negates. A creature that is already

paralyzed by this gaze attack and fails a saving throw to

resist being paralyzed for 1 more round gains 1 negative

level (Fortitude DC 27 to remove after 24 hours). The

paralysis effect of this gaze is a mind-affecting fear

effect, but the negative level is not. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

The ocean knows few terrors as unnatural and horrific

as the sea bonze. This undead goliath dwells near

established shipping lanes or offshore from coastal

settlements, where it lurks just beneath the surface of

the water until it can strike unsuspecting boats in the

dead of night. Sailors often advise launching ocean

voyages only during the day on the assumption that

doing so might protect them from the sea bonze's

attention, but such tactics make little difference to

the creature itself, which will trail a particular ship

until after dusk, sometimes for hundreds of miles, only to

lurch out of the water and lay waste to an entire ship.

Sea bonzes are formed from the combined despair and

horror of death at sea, such as when a ship sinks and its

entire crew drowns. No single restless soul empowers a

sea bonze-it combines the anger and doom of all who die

in such close proximity. Reawakened as mammoth shipwreckers,

these angry spirits have no memory of their

past lives, and seek to inf lict the doom they suffered on

others who ply the seas. Their hatred does not make them

mindless, however, and more than one lucky crew member

has talked her entire ship's way out of total annihilation.

Sea bonzes have an unusual respect for those with wit and

guile, and will sometimes consider sparing those they deem

worthy of their esteem. Those who try to defend themselves

with brawn and weapons, however, receive no mercy from

the enormous monsters.

A sea bonze's f lesh is black and leathery like that of a

squid, and appears at first glance to be made out of the

black waters of the ocean itself. The entire creature is

featureless and smooth, making its empty visage all the

more horrifying.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Elusive (Ex) As a full-round action while in water, a deep sea

serpent can move up to its run speed (200 feet) without

leaving any trace of its passing (identical in effect to pass

without trace). An elusive deep sea serpent gains a +40

circumstance bonus on its Stealth check. In addition, except

when in combat, a sea serpent is considered to be under

the effects of a nondetection spell. Both of these effects

function at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled.

Powerful Tail (Ex) A deep sea serpent's tail slap is always a

primary attack. When a deep sea serpent deals damage to

an object with its tail slap or via constrict damage, it ignores

the first 10 points of hardness that object possesses.

Surge (Ex) A deep sea serpent can surge forward as a fullround

action at a speed of 400 feet. It must move in a

straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity

while surging.

An enormous monstrosity that makes its home in the

darkest depths of the ocean's trenches, the deep sea serpent

is as elusive as it is terrifying, the nightmare of sailors

making their ways over the vast and seemingly bottomless

waters. A deep sea serpent is rarely seen unless it wishes

to be seen, and the beast usually has its own mysterious

reasons for occasionally coming to the surface. At other

times, those reasons are gruesomely obvious-the deep

sea serpent rises to the surface to crush ships and devour

sailors who tumble from the freshly shattered hulls.

It is thought that in incredibly remote parts of the

underwater world, even more powerful deep sea serpents

exist, beasts with supernatural luminous lures that

can be used to blind foes, or with the ability to create

overwhelming blasts of electricity that stun or even

outright slay prey with a single stroke. Yet perhaps the

most unnerving are the rumors of deep sea serpents that

possess a remarkable intelligence. Such creatures, if they

even exist, are rarely if ever seen near the surface-both

their naturally elusive natures and the

remote reality of their habitats mean

that ensuring the veracity of

these claims requires truly

extraordinary efforts.

A typical deep sea

serpent measures 50

feet long and weighs

35,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Bay (Su) When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all

creatures within a 300-foot spread except evil outsiders

must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become panicked for

1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A

creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the

same mastiff's bay for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting

fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Shadow Blend (Su) In any condition of illumination other

than full daylight, a shadow mastiff disappears into the

shadows, giving it concealment (50% miss chance).

Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell,

does not negate this ability; a daylight spell, however,

does. A shadow mastiff can suspend or resume this ability

as a free action.

Tireless hunters, stealthy trackers, and deadly predators,

shadow mastiffs stalk the dark corners of the Outer Planes,

preying upon all beings that stray from the light. These

beasts have little in common with actual canines aside

from their general forms (although with the notable

addition of a long, spiked tail), their bodies being the

evolution of countless centuries hunting the most merciless

wildernesses of the Outer Planes and the Shadow Plane. On

the Material Plane, they prefer to travel in shadow, moving

soundlessly and unseen to find prey, hunting in vicious

sport just as often as in hunger. Shadow mastiffs stand over

4 feet tall, with most weighing nearly 300 pounds.

In combat, these stealthy beasts prefer to fight in

shadows; they shy from areas of bright light unless faced

with no other choice and use their bay to force their

enemies to f lee from well-lit areas. Shadow mastiffs prefer

to hunt in groups, using pack tactics to lure prey into

traps and to draw it away from sources of light. They do

not make lairs, and are usually not found with any sort of

treasure, unless it is on the body of a recently slain victim.

Shadow mastiffs are popular guardians among

spellcasters capable of conjuring them via lesser planar

ally or lesser planar binding. Undead spellcasters and evil

outsiders are immune to shadow mastiffs' fearful bay;

others who are not immune might intentionally expose

themselves to the creatures' bay at some point during the

daylight hours when the resulting panic won't directly

impact other tasks. As a general rule, it's safe to assume

that any site using shadow mastiffs as guardians has

already been affected by the bay, and that its inhabitants

are thus immune to the ability's effects for the remaining

24 hours of that day.

Larger shadow mastiffs exist-creatures the size of

horses or even bigger. These creatures have

different shapes, looking less like dogs

and more like larger creatures

such as lions, dinosaurs, or even

dragons. Such creatures have

additional racial Hit Dice,

and could even have extra

abilities such as f light

or breath weapons.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Cold (Su) A shae's touch

saps heat from living creatures,

leaving patches of colorless flesh rather

than physical wounds. A shae can deal 1d6 points of cold

damage with a touch. It adds +1d6 points of cold damage to

any melee weapon damage it deals.

Lesser Shadow Evocation (Sp) This spell-like ability functions

identically to the spell shadow evocation, but it can only

create quasi-real versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation

spells of 2nd level or lower. This spell-like ability is the

equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

The mysterious people known as the shaes are natives

of the Shadow Plane. In their own language, their name

means "unbound" or "unfettered." According to shae

history, they were once humanoids who through tireless

study and self-perfection managed to transcend the

bonds of a definite form. Though they still bear roughly

humanoid shapes, shaes' outlines are perpetually wispy

and impossible for any non-shaes to focus directly on.

Though shaes may engage in all the same pursuits and

professions as other humanoids, their overwhelming

racial pride often leads them to see all other humanoids-

especially humans-as lesser beings. Ironically, this

casual disdain sometimes leads individual shaes to

gather harems of worshipful human consorts, and it is

from these unions that fetchlings often issue. Humans

involved in such relationships often hope to learn the

secret of the shaes' power over shadows, and claim that

only in sacred union with the creatures can one glimpse

their true features.

Shaes are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds.

They often wear masks and form-fitting clothing when

around other creatures in order to give the lesser beings

something to focus on (such garments do not impede

their blur ability).

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Prescience (Su) A shedu can see all the possible

outcomes of any of its own futures. This

grants the creature an insight bonus

to its AC and on initiative checks and

Reflex saves equal to its Wisdom

bonus (+6 for most shedus).

Shedus live far from the hustle and bustle of humanity in

harsh deserts. There they populate caves, ruins, or ancient

temples reclaimed from the shifting sands. In these places

of refuge, shedus contemplate the struggle between good

and evil throughout the universe. Tireless vehicles of good

and kindness, shedus fight against outsiders who corrupt

and threaten humanity. Skilled in healing, shedus focus

on eliminating plagues, even hunting down outsiders and

undead working in that destructive medium.

Shedus rarely make their homes near each other. This

is not out of any sort of animosity, but rather from a feeling

that having two or more shedus within close proximity

wastes the opportunity to provide aid to a larger region.

When a shedu roams through the lands of another, it

always seeks out the local shedu for an opportunity to talk

and share knowledge over the course of 3 days. After this

period, the visiting shedu departs with a new perspective

and more points to ponder in its eternal struggle against

the evils of the world.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Destroy Soul (Su) A shinigami possesses six gems in which it

encapsulates souls with its soul bind spell-like ability. These

gems are only useful to the shinigami that owns them, and

if the shinigami dies, the gems are destroyed as well. As

a standard action once per day, a shinigami can hold up a

gem that currently contains a soul and crush it, permanently

destroying the soul within and releasing a 30-foot-radius

burst of negative energy that inflicts 1d6 negative levels

on all creatures in the area of effect. A successful DC 30

Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level. The soul

destroyed in the process of using this ability can only be

brought back to life by means of a miracle or wish spell. This

is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Feared as truly impartial and merciless harbingers of death,

shinigamis are relentless in their pursuit of dispensing

quick and just deaths upon those who would seek to disrupt

the delicate balance of life. Unlike other, more sinister

bringers of doom, shinigamis do not take pleasure in their

work and do not seek to impose suffering-although

there are exceptions. Some individuals, aptly described by

their kin as "rogue shinigamis," subscribe to either more

merciful or more despicable forms of execution, and are

either lawful good or lawful evil. Victims who have had

their lives spared by kind shinigamis praise the angels

of death for their clemency and willingness to listen to

the victims' plight, while other dastardly survivors have

successfully cheated or bribed their way out of death by

manipulating credulous or less honorable shinigami. A

shinigami is 9 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Aura of Peace (Su) Creatures within a 50-foot spread from

a simurgh feel a sensation of peace wash over them, as if

affected by calm emotions, except the simurgh can choose

which creatures are affected. A DC 28 Will save negates

the effects of this aura for 1 round, but a new save must

be made each round to continue to resist the effects. The

saving throw is Charisma-based.

Banishing Swipe

(Su) A simurgh

can use its radiant

tail to return creatures

to their native planes. In

addition to taking damage,

any extraplanar creature

touched by a simurgh's

tail must succeed at a DC 28

Will save or be affected as

if by banishment. A creature

that makes this save cannot

be affected by the same

simurgh's banishing swipe for

the next 24 hours. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Glaring Ray (Su) A simurgh can blast a

fiery ray of brilliant light from its eyes as

a standard action to a range of 100 feet.

Radiant Feathers (Su) Once per day as a

standard action, a simurgh can fan out its

glimmering tail feathers and blast its foes with a 100-foot

cone of radiant light from its tail. Aside from its size, this

attack is identical to a prismatic spray (DC 28). The save is

Charisma-based.

Regarded as living legends, simurghs are held in high

regard by desert dwellers. Those who live in the desert

lands where these benevolent creatures sometimes

reside consider it a lifetime's worth of luck even to spot

one soaring through the sky. Simurghs prefer to keep to

themselves, well out of the way of lesser creatures and their

often dubious morals, though they can be relied upon for

aid when called by those in true need and with a pure heart.

A simurgh can live for thousands of years, and frequent

mentions of these giant avian beings throughout a region's

historical record are more often than not sightings of the

same creature.

are concerned. The most commonly encountered

siyokoys are those that dwell amid the caves and crags

of coral reefs in relatively shallow oceanic waters. These

siyokoys tend to have colorful patterns on their f lesh

to mimic the riot of hues the typical coral reef

displays. Reef-dwelling siyokoys are fond of

decorating their lairs with particularly

strange or colorful specimens of

coral, especially when such

marine growths encrust

sunken treasures.

A siyokoy variant

that is encountered

less frequently

dwells in the

deeper abysses

of the ocean, far

below the limits

of the sun's

ability to light.

These siyokoys are

darker colored,

and they tend

to be darker in

personality as well. Whereas

those dwelling in the bright, sunlit

environs of a coral reef might be capricious

or playful, those who dwell in the dark, vast deeps of the

sea are often morbid, morose, and even sadistic. Most evil

siyokoys dwell in such lightless, forgotten reaches of the

world's oceans.

Regardless of where they dwell, siyokoys adore

shipwrecks and long-forgotten ruins claimed by the

oceans. Exploring these relics and recovering strange and

wondrous treasures is what most siyokoys live for, and a

siyokoy's lair is often decorated with the results of these

scavenging expeditions to sunken ships and f looded

cities. Strangely, siyokoys avoid making their lairs amid

such ruins, mostly out of a strange superstition the

creatures share about these areas-it is not lucky, say

siyokoys, to sleep in a place where air breathing creatures

have drowned.

A siyokoy is 7 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Breath Weapon (Su) As a standard

action, a sleipnir can exhale a 30-

foot cone of shimmering, rainbowcolored

light. Every creature in the

area is randomly struck by one or

more beams, as a prismatic spray

spell (DC 22 half or negates).

The sleipnir may use this ability

once every 1d6 rounds, up to 3

times per day. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Sleipnirs are a legendary

breed of magical, eightlegged

horses. Most

sleipnirs have jet-black

coats and long, f lowing

manes and tails, though

occasionally a sleipnir

foal is born with a white or shimmering silver coat. Such

rare sleipnirs sometimes display additional abilities

beyond those of their darker kin. A typical sleipnir stands

6 to 7 feet tall at the shoulder, measures about 12 feet long,

and weighs upward of 1,600 pounds.

Believed to be descended from the mystical steeds of

gods, sleipnirs have spread throughout the Material Plane.

While sleipnirs cannot actually f ly, they are able to walk

on air as easily as on land, and spend much of their time

galloping across the skies of their homes. Although sleipnirs

lack the ability to travel between planes themselves, riders

have brought them as mounts far beyond the Material

Plane, and populations of sleipnirs can be found on several

of the more hospitable Outer Planes as well.

Sleipnirs are highly prized as steeds, but as intelligent




	RACETYPE:Magical Beast 


	s, they cannot be trained using the Handle

Animal skill, and those trying to do so find them

intractable and even violent. Although they cannot speak,

sleipnirs understand Auran, and one seeking a sleipnir

as a mount must convince the creature to serve using

Diplomacy, Intimidate, or other means. Sleipnirs are

generally indifferent to most creatures, meaning they can

be found serving as steeds to creatures of all alignments,

from good to evil.

Riding a sleipnir requires no equipment other than a

normal saddle, and they are well trained in combat from

birth. A rider does not need to make a Ride check to control

a sleipnir in battle, but must make a Ride check to attack

in the same round that the sleipnir attacks. A sleipnir can

carry 519 pounds as a light load, 1,038 pounds as a medium

load, and 1,560 pounds as a heavy load.

Sleipnir-Snake Swarm

Sphinx

The enigmatic sphinxes are closely related, yet diverse in

appearance, intellect, and personality. All combine a lion's

body, a falcon's wings, and a head of some other species.

The most intelligent and powerful of the species sport

humanoid heads-either male or female. The two types of

humanoid-headed sphinxes are, in fact, separate races, not

merely separate genders. These humanoid-headed races

are often called androsphinxes and gynosphinxes, terms

many sphinxes consider demeaning. Lesser sphinxes

have the heads of beasts and are invariably male; the most

commonly encountered are the ram-headed criosphinxes

and the savage, falcon-headed criosphinxes. Sphinxes deny

any common ancestry with other leonine hybrids such as

griffins and manticores, let alone celestial beings like

lammasus, and find such lines of conversation distasteful.

Sphinxes prefer warm desert climes and the hills nearby,

both for the comforting warmth and the pleasant solitude.

The more intelligent sphinxes have contrary social natures,

alternately craving conversation and isolation as the mood

strikes them. Indeed, a bored or irritated sphinx often

takes leave in the midst of discussion, or perhaps slays and

devours its petitioners out of sheer annoyance.

While sphinxes as a race are not truly immortal, they are

fantastically long-lived, save for the violent hieracosphinxes,

who rarely survive their second decade. Unless slain by

accident, violence, or misadventure, other sphinxes seem

to pass on only when they have at last wearied of living

and will themselves to die. The older a sphinx is, the less it

needs consume. The oldest of sphinxes dine perhaps once

per century, making them ideal guardians for monuments,

temples, and tombs.

Sphinxes prefer to converse in their own tongue, but

most speak the languages of humans and dragons as

well. Addressing a sphinx in its own language with all

due politeness and deference goes a long way to ensure

peaceful conversation. All sphinxes save hieracosphinxes

enjoy stimulating conversation, though for such longlived

creatures their memory for detail is sadly lacking. In

some cultures, "a mind like a sphinx" serves as a sarcastic

alternative to "scatter-brained."

Though sphinxes have a reputation for loving riddles, in

truth, only gynosphinxes truly enjoy them. Androsphinxes

prefer lofty philosophical discussions, while criosphinxes

prefer worldly topics or fawning praise. Hieracosphinxes

rarely converse at all, and respond only to threats from

creatures more powerful than they are.

Neighboring humanoids generally adopt a policy of

avoiding local sphinxes, as the creatures grow increasingly

irritable each time their solitude is invaded. Even so, once

a sphinx's lair is known, it can expect a steady f low of

visitors in search of the fabled wisdom of its race. Some

sphinxes move to quieter abodes once the interruptions

become too much to bear; others devour a few of the more

irritating supplicants until the visits cease.

Sphinxes have peculiar breeding habits, contributing in

no small part to their scarcity and the strange diversity

of their species. Indeed, matters of mating occupy much

of the thoughts of all of the sphinxes save the prudish

androsphinxes. The female gynosphinxes have nothing

but scorn for animal-headed sphinxes, craving only the

attentions of the masculine androsphinxes. For their part,

androsphinxes consider petty rutting a waste of time and

energy, both of which are better spent on loftier pursuits

than the f leeting pleasures of the f lesh. Criosphinxes and

hieracosphinxes alike lust after gynosphinxes. The former

abase themselves and attempt to curry favor with lavish

gifts. Hieracosphinxes scorn any such civilized gestures,

and mate by force on the rare occasions they have a female

at their mercy.

From these rare couplings, two to four sphinxes of any

type may be born, regardless of the breed of the parents.

Instead, the nature of the coupling itself inf luences

the species of the resulting offspring. From those rare

matings engendered by love or respect, androsphinxes

and gynosphinxes are born. Those couplings motivated

by carnal lust or selfish urges most often produce

criosphinxes. Hieracosphinxes come from acts of hate and

violence, and their disgusted mothers quickly abandon

them to the mercy of the elements, lest the young turn

against them. Of all the males, only the criosphinx

willingly helps rear its own young, often as part of the

bargain for mating in the first place.

People of the desert sometimes honor the sphinx's

form by crafting great stone sphinxes, often bearing the

faces of their own rulers and nobles. Legend holds the

first such monuments were modeled on the eldest and

greatest of sphinxes, paragons of knowledge and wisdom

far larger in size than any common sphinx. The oldest

and largest of these sphinxes settled into the desert sands

when at last they tired of immortality, and as they passed

into their final sleep, their bodies became as sandstone.

These elder sphinxes may be androsphinxes or

gynosphinxes, or very rarely criosphinxes. They have

at minimum the advanced template, many additional

Hit Dice, and a size of at least


	SIZE:H


	(and more often

Gargantuan or Colossal). They can use commune, contact

other plane, and legend lore as spell-like abilities once each

per day (CL equals the sphinx's CR), and frequently possess

other powers and special attacks. Many such sphinxes can

enter a state of stony suspended animation that resembles

the freeze special ability, though they cannot easily rouse

themselves from such slumber. Other sphinxes, even the

bestial hieracosphinxes, defer to elder sphinxes in all

matters, treating them almost as gods.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Roar (Su) An androsphinx can roar up to three

times per day as a standard action. Each

progressive roar has a different effect,

depending upon whether it is the first,

second, or third of the androsphinx's

roars for that day. All of these roars are

sonic effects that fill a 60-foot-radius

burst, centered on the androsphinx; the

save DCs are Charisma-based. Sphinxes

are immune to all of the effects of an

androsphinx's roars.

First Roar: Affected creatures become frightened for

2d6 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting

fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.

Second Roar: Affected creatures are paralyzed with fear and

deafened for 1d4 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mindaffecting

fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.

Third Roar: Affected creatures take a 2d4 penalty to

Strength for 2d4 rounds and take 2d8 points of sonic

damage. Creatures smaller than the androsphinx are

knocked prone. A DC 19 Fortitude save negates the

Strength penalty and being knocked prone.

Spells An androsphinx casts divine spells as a 6th-level cleric.

They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.

The mightiest of the common sphinxes, androsphinxes

see themselves as all that is worthy and noble in the species

and carry themselves as though the weight of the world

rests upon their good example. They view criosphinxes

with paternalistic condescension, hieracosphinxes with

poorly veiled disgust, and gynosphinxes as the only other

sphinxes worthy of their time.

Androsphinxes put on a gruff and cantankerous front

to outsiders. They make no effort to hide annoyance when

displeased. Androsphinxes tend to be territorial, though

less so than other sphinxes. They almost invariably warn

and bluster before attacking, and nearly always heed a

call to parley. Androsphinxes barter information and

conversation for safe passage, not treasure.

Androsphinxes are 12 feet

tall and weigh 1,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Swooping Charge (Ex) A charging criosphinx

deals 4d4+12 points of damage with its gore

attack. A flying criosphinx who drops

at least 20 feet in altitude as part of a

charge deals 6d4+18 points instead.

Perhaps the least leonine of

all sphinxes, the ram-headed

criosphinx lacks the intellect of

androsphinxes and gynosphinxes,

but still outmatches the dim-witted

hieracosphinxes. Like hieracosphinxes and

androsphinxes, criosphinxes are always male.

At the start of a battle, a criosphinx lowers its horns

and crashes into foes, clawing enemies it has engaged.

It favors charging down on foes from great heights.

Criosphinxes crave wealth over nearly all other things,

habitually extorting tolls for safe passage from any who pass

their lands. Groups who cannot pay must yield one of their

number or a pair of mounts for the criosphinx's meal-

single travelers must fight or die. Unlike gynosphinxes,

no mere riddle suffices-only the shine of metal or the

gleam of jewels can satisfy a criosphinx. Little can convince

a criosphinx to part with even a single coin save the lust

that its kind bears for the gynosphinx. Criosphinxes crave

mating with gynosphinxes above all else, and pay well for

the whereabouts of a female, or better yet, a well-crafted

riddle that might impress one. For their part, gynosphinxes

prefer to have little to do with what they mock as the sheep

of sphinxes, though they sometimes lower themselves to a

brief assignation in the rare event a criosphinx manages to

impress them with wealth or wit.

Some criosphinxes set themselves as soothsayers of the

desert, trading upon the storied wisdom of androsphinxes

and gynosphinxes to deceive gullible travelers. Like their

more blustering brethren, they seek wealth from passersby,

but for the purposes of dispersing information rather than

in exchange for safe passage. Such reliable information as

they possess usually comes from idle conversation with the

creatures of the desert, with criosphinxes using their inborn

ability to speak with animals. A criosphinx lacking in sound

information usually fabricates a pleasing lie.

Criosphinxes detest hieracosphinxes, regarding

them as little more than beasts and a disgrace to

their noble race. They drive off their falconheaded

cousins with mock-charges and

posturing, escalating to full-f ledged

attacks if ignored. Androsphinxes

they view with mixed fear and

respect, and gynosphinxes with

disdain and lust.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Shriek (Su) The shrill shriek of a hieracosphinx deafens nonsphinxes

within a 60-foot-radius spread for 2d4 rounds (DC

16 Fortitude negates). Once a creature successfully saves

against this effect, it is immune to the hieracosphinx's

shriek for 24 hours. Using this ability is a standard action.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

The least intelligent of the common sphinxes,

hieracosphinxes are a cowardly, cruel-hearted lot. All are

male. They despise the larger and cleverer androsphinxes

and criosphinxes. Toward gynosphinxes they hold a twisted

mix of a lust and hate, simultaneously envying their beauty

and power while craving them as mates. Hieracosphinxes

attack other sphinxes whenever they have them

at a disadvantage. Male sphinxes of other species they

tear to shreds or drive away, whereas they prefer to leave

gynosphinxes ravaged but alive. The other species of sphinx

likewise hold nothing but disdain for hieracosphinxes, and

typically attack these vile beasts on sight.

Hieracosphinxes guard their territory ruthlessly against

weaker intruders, seldom giving warning before they attack.

They have no use for banter and riddles, making most efforts

at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be convinced to call

off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled with

information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx.

Though poor f liers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the

better to escape if the combat turns against them.

As they lack the ego and resourcefulness of the rest of

their breed, hieracosphinxes can be pressed into service of

mounts, particularly by those of similarly evil dispositions.

Hieracosphinxes chafe under such service but submit to

more powerful riders, though they still inf lict their foul

tempers on any weaker creatures that happen by. A grown

hieracosphinx can easily consume a full horse's worth of meat

in a day, making their upkeep rather expensive. Even with

these drawbacks, hieracosphinx eggs command values of up

to 1,500 gp on the open market, as do young hieracosphinxes.

It takes 3 years for a hieracosphinx to reach maturity, after

which an untrained hieracosphinx only rarely accepts a rider

without magical compulsion. Trainers, though hard to come

by, charge thousands of gold pieces to rear and train a

hieracosphinx, owing to the risk to life and limb.

A light load for a hieracosphinx is up to 350

pounds; a medium load, 351-700 pounds;

and a heavy load, 701-1,050 pounds. A

typical hieracosphinx is just short of

9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds.

Hieracosphinxes detest bearing a

rider into battle, thus increasing

the DCs of any combat-related

Ride checks by +5.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Implant (Ex) A spider eaters grows its eggs inside of a living

host. Implanting an egg in a host is a full-round action

that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the target must

be helpless but alive. Once an egg is implanted, it exudes

paralytic enzymes that not only keep the victim in state of

perpetual paralysis, but also keep it nourished and alive in

its comatose but fully aware state. This condition lasts until

the egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, at which point the young

spider eater consumes most of its host, killing it. An egg

can be surgically removed with a DC 25 Heal check (this

check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of

success), at which point the host recovers from the paralysis

in 1d6 rounds. Any magical effect that removes paralysis or

disease (such as remove paralysis, remove disease, or heal)

also destroys the egg, but mere immunity to paralysis or

disease does not offer protection.

Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/minute

for 6 minutes; effect paralysis for 1 minute; cure 1 save. The

save DC is Constitution-based.

An amalgam of dangerous creatures, this predator, as its

name suggests, prefers to hunt and feed upon spiders.

Their greatest boon to spider hunting, aside from their

stinger, ability to f ly, and strong pincers, is their ability

to slip through the stickiest of webs in order to get to their

prey. Unfortunately for other creatures, when a spider eater

is denied its preferred prey, it seeks out any living creature

it can find to serve as a host for its ravenous young.

When hunting, a spider eater drops from the air onto

its victim, stinging the prey with its barbed tail. The

creature then returns to the air and hovers, waiting for

its venom to take hold. Once the opponent succumbs to

paralysis, the spider eater lands again, either to feed or

implant its egg.

Although more intelligent than the typical beast, to the

point where it can understand a language (usually Aklo),

the spider eater is relatively slow-witted. Nevertheless, it

is intelligent enough that it resists training-those who

seek to ally with spider eaters must befriend them via

diplomacy and gifts of spiders to feed upon or implant

eggs into, or via intimidation and coercion.

A spider eater measures roughly 14 feet long and stands

6 feet tall. The creature has a wingspan just over 20 feet

and weighs almost 2,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Luminous (Su) A sprite naturally sheds light

equal to that provided by a torch. A sprite can

control the color and intensity of the light as a

swift action, reducing it to the dimness of a candle

or even extinguishing its luminosity entirely if it wishes.

Sprites gather in groups deep in

forested lands, aligned to the

cause of defending nature. Whole

tribes of sprites deem themselves

protectors of a certain person, place, or

creature of importance in their lands,

even if the being doesn't actually want or

need protecting.

A sprite's body is naturally luminous, although the

sprite can vary the color and intensity of its body as it

wishes. Shortly after death, a sprite's body simply melts

away to a twinkling vapor. Sprites are among the smallest

of fey, standing just over 9 inches in height and rarely

weighing more than 1 or 2 pounds.

Sprites are more primitive in many ways than most

fey. They enjoy each other's company, but tend to be

distrustful of other fey and assume any humanoids and

any other creatures that they haven't expressly chosen to

protect mean to do them ill. Even animals are generally

regarded as dangerous. Much of this is due to sprites'

diminutive size, which makes them popular targets for

predators. As a result, a sprite's initial reaction to danger

is typically to f lee-it uses its spell-like abilities to delay

or distract pursuers, and relies on its speed in f light and

its size to allow it to escape in the end.

While sprites themselves are relatively uncultured and

savage in nature, they do have a healthy curiosity for all

things magical in nature. They are particularly drawn to

sites of great but latent magical power, such as the ruins

of ancient temples. This curiosity makes them unusually

receptive to roles as familiars as well. A 5th-level chaotic

neutral spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can

gain a sprite as a familiar.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Glare (Su) As a standard action, in any area of

normal or brighter light, a stymphalidies can ruffle its

metallic feathers in such a way as to blind all creatures

nearby. Any creature within 30 feet must succeed at a

DC 19 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d6 minutes. A

creature can defend against this effect in the same way

it would a gaze attack. This is a sight-based effect. The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Wing Razors (Ex) A stymphalidies's metallic feathers are

razor-sharp. In addition to being able to slash creatures with

its wings as a melee attack, it may beat its wings, flinging

two large, feathered shards at a single target. These wing

razors deal 2d6 points of damage and cause bleed, with a

range increment of 50 feet. A stymphalidies can use this

attack a number of times per day equal to its Constitution

modifier (5 times per day for most stymphalidies).

Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as

stymphalidies stalk plains and coastlines, shredding

warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their

steely-bladed feathers and daggerlike beaks. From a

distance, stymphalidies might easily be mistaken for

cranes, ibises, or other long-necked birds, though in full

sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood

lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake.

When not at rest, f locks of the creatures soar high on

warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to

spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious

appetites, f locks of stymphalidies must claim a vast

swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits.

Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalidies

rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids

and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of

these metallic-winged avians. Stymphalidies breed at

an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and

exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily

large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together

in search of new lands and new prey to devour.

Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalidies are

made of steel-like material similar to the metallic hide

of a gorgon. Smaller varieties of stymphalidies exist,

including a variant with a penchant for swarming, but

the towering creature presented here is by far the most

commonly encountered of its kind. This stymphalidies

stands 13 feet tall, with a wingspan of 25 feet and a weight

of 250 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Elemental Assault (Su) Once per day as a swift

action, a suli can call on the elemental power

lurking in its veins to shroud its arms in

acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Unarmed

strikes with its elbows or hands (or

attacks with weapons held in those

hands) deal +1d6 points of damage

of the appropriate energy type. This

lasts for 1 round per level. The suli

can end the effects of its elemental

power early as a free action.

Sulis (or suli-jann) are minor offshoots of the jann that

live among humans. They are tall and look like ordinary

men and women but for their abnormal beauty and the

occasional f lash of elemental light in their eyes. Though

physically superior to and more attractive than normal

humans, some suli-jann remain unaware of their genie

heritage until later in life, when contact with a full-blooded

genie draws forth a portion of their elemental power.

While all sulis can trace their lineage back to a janni

ancestor, very few have an immediate janni parent.

In most cases, this legacy lies fallow in the blood for

generations, only to emerge decades or even centuries

later. Those whose powers become apparent early on

usually lead troubled lives as youths, as the question of

a child's origins tears some families apart; few of these

unfortunate sulis grow up knowing anything of the peace

of a happy home.

Sulis age at the same rate as humans and are physically

identical to humans in terms of height and weight. During

their youth, sulis tend to be slightly smaller than their

fully human peers, but grow quickly to their full

adult height upon reaching their teenage

years. Sulis are impulsive and passionate

by nature, and even those sulis who know

nothing of their genie blood possess a

measure of personal pride.

SULI CHARACTERS

Sulis are defined by class levels-they

do not possess racial Hit Dice. Sulis

have the following racial traits.

+2 Strength, +2 Charisma, -2

Intelligence: Sulis tend to be strong

and charming, but slow-witted.

Low-Light Vision: Sulis

can see twice as far as

humans in dim light.

Negotiator: Sulis are

keen negotiators, and gain

a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and

Sense Motive checks.

Elemental Assault: See above.

Elemental Resistance: Sulis

have resistance to acid 5, cold 5,

electricity 5, and fire 5.

Languages: Sulis begin play speaking

Common and any one elemental

language of their choice (Aquan, Auran,

Ignan, or Terran). Sulis with high

Intelligence scores can choose from

among the following bonus

languages: Aquan, Auran,

Draconic, Ignan, and Terran.

ECOLOGY

a gourd, other treasure)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Sake Affinity (Su) As a swift action, a tanuki can take a

swig of sake from the gourd it always carries at its

side. When it does so, it gains the effect of one of

the following spells at caster level 7th: divine favor,

false life, haste, or rage. Unusual tanukis might have

additional spell effect choices at the GM's discretion.

Each time a tanuki takes a swig of sake, it becomes

progressively drunker and takes a -1 penalty to its AC

and on Reflex saves for 1 minute. These penalties stack.

Jolly tricksters, tanukis love deceiving humanoids and

other intelligent creatures. This mischief is usually

harmless, but can turn spiteful in some situations.

Popular folklore stories claim tanukis are the transformed

souls of tools and housewares that were used for more

than 100 years, a myth that probably results from tanukis'

ability to magically create or alter objects.

Mostly encountered in disguise, tanukis enjoy visiting

humanoid settlements and interacting with the people.

They usually visit taverns and eateries, joining in feasts

and celebrations whenever possible. Tanukis always

change their disguises and rarely visit the same town twice

in the same month.

Tanuki mischief becomes spiteful to those who defile

nature. Hunters who kill for sport or those who log trees

from the forest without seeding new ones find their

weapons and tools transformed into bowls and teacups.

Tanukis also put more effort into their pranks when the

target is a braggart, a bully, or someone of poor moral

character. They like to prank brooding types as well,

always hoping to bring a smile to the hard faces of such

dour folk. Because of their trickster nature, tanukis get

along with many fey creatures. Some tanukis even deal

well with spirits, often helping them pass from this world.

Though rare, violent and morbid tanukis occasionally

walk the lands, bringing suffering to those they encounter.

Filled with spite, these evil tanukis pull sadistic pranks, and

horror stories tell of tanukis killing old women and tricking

their husbands into eating soups made from their f lesh.

A tanuki is 5 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Swallow Whole (Su) A taotieh can expand its jaws to swallow

Large or smaller creatures. When swallowed, a victim is

transported to its own lightless pocket dimension-a stone

prison just large enough to contain the victim. Creatures do

not take damage within this pocket dimension, but there is

only enough air inside to last for 3 rounds. At the end of the

third round, the trapped creature must hold its breath or risk

suffocation. A creature that attempts to carve its way out of

this dimension with a weapon must be

able to penetrate the surrounding

walls' hardness 8. When a

creature manages to cut

its way out of this

dimension,

it appears to leap out of the taotieh's mouth to emerge

into any square adjacent to the taotieh's space-no actual

hole is created in the creature, and new creatures that are

swallowed later must cut their own way out. When a taotieh

is destroyed, its body bursts open to allow the contents of its

extradimensional stomachs to spill out into adjacent spaces.

A taotieh can swallow up to four creatures at any one time.

Symbols of power but also of gluttony, taotiehs are guardian

constructs formed of stone and built around a pocket of

extradimensional space. Taotiehs are used to ward sacred

or secluded areas from enemies and trespassers. Their

semblance to tigers extends even to the animal's abilities

in combat, as taotiehs are feared for their vicious attacks.

The extradimensional space at the core of a taotieh allows

the construct to swallow opponents of its own size and then

shunt its victims into an airless pocket of space inside. A

creature capable of existing without air could well spend

an eternity inside a taotieh if it couldn't smash its way out

or escape via plane-traversing magic, in which case it must

wait for outside forces to slay its captor. Tales abound of

great treasures and even greater dangers being unleashed

upon a taotieh's destruction.

A taotieh is built from 12,000 pounds of marble, treated

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Poison Gasp (Ex) A tatzlwyrm's

breath contains a poisonous

vapor. While grappling, instead

of making a bite or rake

attack, a tatzlwyrm can

breathe poison into its

victim's face. A tatzlwyrm

must begin its turn

grappling to use this ability-it

can't begin a grapple and use its

poison gasp in the same turn.

Tatzlwyrm poison: Breath-inhaled;

save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 2

rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage; cure 1 save.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Tatzlwyrms are thought to be

primeval relatives of true dragons,

having branched off the line

millennia ago and

evolved in a way

that sets them

notably apart. Undersized compared to their larger

cousins, tatzlwyrms are nonetheless ferocious in their

own right. And while tatzlwyrms are hardly impressive

specimens when put beside their notorious relatives,

most other reptiles can't compare to them mentally.

They understand Draconic, though other languages

are beyond most tatzlwyrms' limited comprehension.

Nevertheless, tatzlwyrms are deeply cunning, building

complex lairs and rudimentary traps.

Tatzlwyrms are quite rare, and only a few particularly

curious and lucky adventurers can claim to have seen

a living specimen. Reports do agree on some basic

features, however. About the size of a full-grown

human, tatzlwyrms have only two limbs and no wings,

and possess a weak poisonous breath similar to the

breath weapons of their true dragon relatives. An adult

tatzlwyrm is 6 to 8 feet long, including its winding,

organless tail, and it weighs between 400 and 500

pounds. A tatzlwyrm's scales give the creature limited

camouf lage, ranging through various shades of green,

brown, and gray.

Like true dragons, tatzlwyrms are strict carnivores.

They spend most of their time hiding, waiting to attack

any prey that ventures too near. They consume their

food slowly in the dark security and seclusion of their

lairs. Tatzlwyrms have a remarkable knack for ambush

and camouf lage.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Keen Weapons (Su) After it has engaged in

at least 1 round of combat, a terra-cotta

soldier's weapons automatically gain

the benefits of keen weapon (CL 6th).

This effect persists until the end

of the battle.

Rank Fighting (Ex) Whenever a

terra-cotta soldier is adjacent to

another terra-cotta soldier, it gains

a +2 dodge bonus to its AC and a

+2 bonus on saving throws, attack

rolls, and damage rolls.

A terra-cotta soldier is crafted from

clay and fired into ceramic, and

is usually sculpted to resemble

an armored human soldier,

although terra-cotta soldiers

resembling other races, such as hobgoblins, tengus, or even

demons and oni, are also common. Terra-cotta soldiers

are often created to guard the tomb of powerful rulers,

standing in silent ranks to guard their liege even after

his or her death. These soldiers stand vigil for centuries,

animating only to defend the tomb and its riches from

tomb robbers. Terra-cotta soldiers are typically painted

with colored lacquer, though this decoration is often worn

away from use or faded with age. A terra-cotta soldier

stands 6 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.

Unlike most constructs, a terra-cotta soldier carries

within its form a spark of intelligence. This is hardly

enough to grant the construct the ability to speak or

otherwise engage in free will, but it is enough for it to

carry out more complex tactics than most constructs

are capable of. It's not unusual for a terra-cotta soldier

to possess different feats or use different weapons. Two

relatively common variants are summarized below.

Terra-Cotta Archer (+0 CR): Terra-cotta archers are

simply terra-cotta soldiers outfitted with composite

longbows. Terra-cotta archers have Improved Initiative,

Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, and Weapon Focus

(longbow) as feats.

Terra-Cotta Horseman (+1 CR): Some

terra-cotta soldiers are crafted to resemble

warriors mounted on terra-cotta horses,

though rider and mount are one creature.

Terra-cotta horsemen are

Thriae

Highly spiritual creatures and keepers of the world's

greatest secrets, the thriae are a race of female, beelike

seers coveted for their powers of divination and prophecy.

Roughly humanoid in size and appearance, thriae keep to

the outskirts of civilization, tending to their mysterious

rituals and maintaining a watchful-if passive-eye over

the machinations of nearby societies. While possessing an

eerie air of mysticism, thriae are nonetheless startlingly

beautiful, their slender bodies giving an unexpected grace

to the otherwise unsightly mannerisms of giant bees.

Settlements that find themselves near the hilly homes

of thriae hives often send a chosen citizen to visit the

creatures, hoping to glean helpful insight from the wise

prophetesses regarding the growth of the settlement's

crops, the prosperity of its people, or the strength of its

warriors. Thriae have little interest in the affairs of most

humanoids, but do aid those who come bearing offerings

of gold or physically fit male consorts. All thriae are female,

and so the queen must breed with humanoid males in

order to propagate the colony. If a colony hasn't received an

offering of a suitable consort recently, thriae sometimes

visit nearby settlements in the hope of garnering young

male volunteers to come and live with them for the rest of

their lives-living with the thriae exposes chosen males to

many of the mysterious race's secrets, so the prophetesses

cannot afford to let them leave the thriae's domains once

they have entered. The life of male consorts is one of

comfort and luxury, however, as they spend their days in

a blissful trance brought on by the mind-altering effects

of the thriae queen's nourishing honey, a substance called

merope. Once they are too old to continue their duties,

the males are put in a deep, numbing sleep, whereupon

the thriae painlessly devour the consorts' elderly bodies.

Thriae generally do not have emotional ties to their

humanoid mates, using them for procreation only-

exceptions exist, particularly among non-queen thriae,

who cannot lay eggs but sometimes choose a willing

mate anyway. Only the queen can lay eggs; a typical queen

produce 400 to 500 eggs in her lifetime. The life span of a

typical thriae who does not die in battle is about 200 years.

Thriae choose particularly spiritual individuals to

become seers, members of the colony who perform the

rituals that allow them to divine their cryptic prophecies.

These seers drink from merope and derive meaning from

their spiritual hallucinations, traveling into the forests

or mountains to decode various patterns among nature.

Thriae hold a particular reverence for the structures and

communication patterns of common bees, patterns which

they often study intently while undergoing their meropeinduced

spiritual journeys. The bond thriae have with

common bees and giant bees extends beyond this, however,

as many powerful thriae possess the ability to call forth

such insects when they are in need of aid, such as while

protecting their homes. Thriae are extremely territorial,

and disrupt their normally stoic behavior to passionately

fight off intruders or creatures otherwise imposing upon

their domain. Many thriae colonies can trace back their

lineages thousands of years, keeping extensive archives

hidden within the catacombs of their labyrinthine hives.

The hives thriae reside in resemble the beehives of their

miniature relatives, but constructed on a much grander

fashion and scale. Since thriae f ly wherever they go, they

tend to build their most important chambers higher up in

order to deter bipedal would-be burglars.

Thriae come in various shapes and sizes, their abilities

ranging equally in terms of specialization. An individual

thriae's occupation within the particular thriae society

she is born into is selected by her elders when she reaches

adolescence, several months after her development

as a larva and then as a pupa. Once her occupation is

determined, a young thriae is assigned a "mother," and is

trained by this elder to perform her tasks perfectly so as

to keep the hive in fully autonomous order. Many thriae

never see battle in their lifetimes, instead performing

tasks such as recording scriptures derived from seers'

verbal prophecies, cultivating the crops and herd animals

that thriae use for food, or crafting elaborate crowns,

necklaces, and other ornaments unique to thriae and

renowned by jewelers the world over. Thriae have a

fascination with all kinds of rare metals, and the intricate

ways in which they utilize these alloys in building their

wares exemplifies the race's passion and ingenuity. They

do not regularly trade with outside societies except in

times of dire need, such as during a feud or war that cuts

off access to needed resources.

THRIAE MEROPE

Merope, the magical honey produced by thriae queens,

possesses numerous supernatural properties. Even

among thriae, the effects of drinking merope are

remarkably diverse. A specific amount of merope for

one thriae may put her into a tranquil haze, while the

same amount for another could set off a bout of insatiable

rage. The effect of merope on a specific type of thriae is

marked in a thriae's stat block.

To non-thriae, merope generally has similar effects

to strong alcohol. The substance can be addicting to

the weak-willed, and those who begin to rely on merope

quickly become addicted thralls and servants bound

to servitude within a hive. Some thriae claim to have

developed merope with the ability to affect non-thriae

with more potent effects, but such claims are regarded

as something between blasphemy and treason by most

thriae hives.

ECOLOGY

Organization solitary or colony (1 queen, 3 seers, 11-20 soldiers,

and 3-30 giant bees)

Treasure double (+2 axiomatic light mace, other treasure)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Launch Merope (Su) A thriae queen can launch a stream of

merope from a gland in her lower body in a 60-foot line

as a standard action. A thriae queen using this ability can

control the purity of the merope she launches, which makes

it either harm those it touches or heal them. If a thriae

queen chooses to make her merope harmful, all creatures

in the area of effect take 20d8 points of acid damage

(Reflex DC 29 for half ). In addition, any creature in the

area of effect is also staggered for 1d4 rounds (or 1 round

if it succeeds at its Reflex save). If she uses it to heal, the

merope heals all living creatures in the area of effect for

10d8 points of damage. A thriae queen can use this ability

once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Merope Coat (Su) A thriae queen is covered in a thin layer of

merope. This coating acts as a magical barrier between spells

cast at the thriae queen, as though she were constantly under

the effects of spell turning. The coat affects a maximum of

eight spell levels-when a spell effect is turned, this coating

is depleted by a number of spell levels equal to the level of

the spell reflected. The queen regenerates this coating at a

rate of one spell level per round. A spell in excess of what

the merope coat can currently reflect is not reflected, and

reduces the merope coat to a score of 0. Spells that fail to

penetrate the queen's spell resistance do not reduce the

merope coat's efficiency in this manner.

Spawn Soldiers (Su) Three times per day as a standard action,

a thriae queen can spawn a large swarm of wasps. This

functions as four separate wasp swarms (Bestiary 275) that

occupy all of the squares adjacent to the thriae queen.

These swarms do not harm any thriae, and while they move

with the queen as she moves, the swarms cannot leave her

side. The swarms last until they are destroyed or 1 hour

passes, at which point the swarms die on their own.

Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/round

for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con plus staggered for 1 round; cure

2 consecutive saves.

The most powerful individual within any given thriae

colony, the queen is a divine soothsayer, a provider of life,

and a destroyer of those would seek to disrupt the order

of the colony. Viewed by her children as a benevolent

matriarch rather than a mother, the thriae queen is the only

fertile member of the colony, and thus the sole reproducer

should the colony's population meet a devastating blow,

whether through plague, famine, or war. A queen is revered

by soldiers and seers alike, both for her physical might and

her divine power, and she exemplifies the very best of thriae

society in terms of strength, insight, and magnetism. While

a queen is often too busy to entertain guests of a thriae hive,

those intruders who do catch a glimpse of her are captured

by her beauty and grace, and many would follow her if only to

be by her side. But those who are allowed to enjoy the queen's

company are few, and those few are carefully selected from

among the hive's greatest warriors and priestesses, soldiers

and seers whose powers have shown them to be skillful as

well as loyal.

Most thriae colonies only have one queen, though

particularly large or far-reaching hives have been known

264

Illustration by Maichol Quinto

to have as many as three at any given time. Thriae queens

are the ultimate authority within a hive, and make most of

the major decisions regarding the colony's growth. Only

the wealthiest and most respected outsiders are granted

an audience with the ever-busy queen, whose numerous

duties around the hive are analogous to those of any other

ruler of a small kingdom. They grant only audiences

regarding matters of the utmost concern, matters that

stimulate the curiosity of a thriae queen and require not

merely the cryptic readings of seers but a true divination

as only a queen can provide.

When not divining or performing governmental tasks,

a thriae queen can often be found in her private chamber,

where she lies with male consorts, lays eggs, cares for her

larvae, and creates the vast stores of merope used every

day within the hive. Consorts are chosen carefully, as they

are constantly within extremely close proximity to the

queen, who is far from vulnerable in her own right but

nonetheless often prefers to avoid conf licts with would-be

assassins or burglars.

A thriae queen lays fertilized eggs in one of the waxy,

golden cells of her chamber walls. Thriae eggs go through

several stages of growth before becoming fully formed

thriae-the longest stage of development is the larval stage,

which is a crucial point in determining the formation of

a thriae. Most larvae are fed merope while they grow, but

in the height of her power, a thriae queen selects a single

larva to be her successor, and she feeds that individual a

special substance secreted from her merope gland called

royal merope. This thick, jellylike substance strengthens

the larva and causes it to grow greatly in size, and when it

pupates and hatches, it does so as a fully grown thriae queen.

The mother queen teaches its successor in the ways of

divining as well as ruling a colony. The successor then

faces a choice-either remaining in the colony she was

born into and furthering the growth of the hive, or setting

out on her own to establish an allied colony. If she does

the latter, the remaining queen must birth another

successor, which is not considered so much a bother as

it is an unavoidable circumstance. Queens do not look

upon successors who leave as deserting daughters, instead

viewing them as future allies for the colony down the road.

THRIAE LARVAE

Larvae who are fed regular merope become soldiers, seers,

or other contributing members of thriae society. While

more susceptible to harm in the larval stage, thriae larvae

still pose a threat to unwary intruders who find themselves

among the cells of numerous unhatched thriae. Creatures

that succeed at a DC 15 Perception check or Knowledge

(nature) check notice larvae embedded in the hive's waxy

walls. Unhatched thriae larvae can detect disturbances

outside their cell walls, and burst from the cells in order

to prey upon the nutritious intruders. Any creature within

5 feet of a larval cell must make a DC 15 Ref lex save to avoid

becoming infested with the larvae. A creature that becomes

infested must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save each

round to avoid taking 1d2 points of Constitution damage

and falling asleep-additional Constitution damage from

feeding larvae does not wake sleeping victims. Feeding

larvae can be detached from the creature they cling to by

cutting them off with a slashing weapon (which requires

a DC 20 Heal check that deals 1d4 points of damage per

larva attached) or by dealing cold damage to the larvae at

any time, which also deals half damage to the creature the

larvae are covering. Remove disease or a similar effect kills

any thriae larvae on the host.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Merope Consumption (Su)

Three times per day as a

standard action, a thriae

seer can consume a

dose of merope in order to further tap into her

spiritual powers for 1d6+3 rounds. Starting on

the round after she consumes the merope, the

thriae seer gains an insight bonus to her AC and on damage

done with melee attacks equal to her Wisdom modifier (+6 for

most thriae seers).

Mind Sting (Su) A target stung by a thriae seer becomes

confused for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a successful DC

21 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Sought after for their wisdom and guidance as well as

their enchanting beauty, thriae seers are among the

most spiritually gifted members of their colony. Their

prowess for foretelling the future and deciding upon

the soundest courses of action in dire situations earns

them respect from other thriae as well as outsiders from

other societies, and seers wield their gift with a stoic

humbleness. Nonetheless, most seers expect an offering

before they will grant an audience a divination. These

offerings usually consist of ornate jewelry and sums

of gold, though some seers desire the

company of humanoid male or female

consorts, many of whom gladly oblige the

captivating seer with their presence.

While their combative abilities mainly

comprise their magical powers and they

appear at first glance to be thin and

frail, seers still possess the trademark

strength and resilience of all thriae.

Thriae seers spend most of their

time meditating in one of the many

chambers in the colony's hive dedicated

to such activities. Consuming large

amounts of their queen's merope to

enhance their powers of divination,

seers ponder the best solutions to

their colony's problems, and often act

as a sort of spiritual political council

for the queen. If a particularly

wealthy group of outsiders has

sought the counsel of several thriae

seers, this council of prophetesses

will combine their powers in order to

read a difficult divination.

Thriae seers are 6 feet from head

to toe and weigh 150 pounds. The

thriae seer presented here represents

the least of her kind. Many thriae

seers take levels of monk or rogue

so as to be even more adept at

protecting their queen. Thriae

oracles and sorcerers are also

relatively common-such thriae

are particularly valued by their

hive for their magical abilities.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Merope Consumption (Su) Once per day as a standard action,

a thriae soldier can consume a dose of merope in order to

enhance her combat abilities for 1d6+3 rounds. Starting on

the round after the merope is consumed, the thriae soldier

gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and saving throws,

and gains fast healing 3.

Poison (Ex) Sting or arrow-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency

1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. As a free

action, a thriae soldier can apply her venom to an arrow as

she fires the shot. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The guardians of the thriae colony and its treasures, thriae

soldiers make up the backbone of a hive's defenses. Whether

patrolling the perimeter of the hive or protecting its queen

and seers from attackers, soldiers are a crucial asset

ensuring a colony's survival, and so it makes sense that they

compose the majority of thriae populations. While not as

spiritually powerful as their seer and queen kin, soldiers

possess remarkable

agility and skill with

the bow. Guards remain

stationed in pairs outside

doors to important areas,

such as the meditation

chambers of seers and the

enormous private quarters of

the queen, and when their

duties take them outside the

walls of the hive, they travel in

large convoys.

A thriae soldier's stinger carries within

it especially potent venom similar to that

of giant bees, and the soldier can easily apply

this poison to her weapons. While most soldiers

carry bows, they are also trained at an early age

with a multitude of both melee and ranged weapons, and

some prefer the feel of a sword or hammer. Regardless of

the type, all thriae weapons and armors are expertly crafted,

made of steel and gilded with intricate decorations of gold

and amber-hued gems. Thriae soldiers are often talented

artisans as well as warriors, and most create their own

weapons to bear in combat.

Since there are exponentially more soldiers than seers

in any given colony, thriae queens ration merope sparingly

to soldiers, whose use of it doesn't provoke the divine

insight cherished by thriae culture, but rather inspires

courage and brute strength on the battlefield. When a

thriae soldier consumes merope, her ref lexes quicken,

her wits sharpen, and she gains a second wind, so most

individuals save their rationed doses for times of dire need.

When circumstances are especially grim, commanders of

thriae militias will order all of their troops to consume

their merope at once, giving the company the final burst

of strength it needs to turn the tide of battle.

Thriae soldiers are heavier-set than most of their

slender thriae sisters, and average individuals weigh

about 200 pounds and measure 6 feet from head to toe.

ECOLOGY

Environment any

Treasure triple (50-100 various weapons, other treasure)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Hands of War (Su) Any weapon a hekatonkheires wields

gains a +3 enhancement bonus while the titan holds it. A

hekatonkheires's attacks are treated as epic and evil for the

purposes of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, a

hekatonkheires's multitude of arms allows it to effectively

block attacks, granting it a +8 armor bonus to its AC.

Hundred-Handed Whirlwind (Ex) A hekatonkheires carries

several dozen weapons of various types in its hundred

hands, but when it attacks in melee, you don't have to

resolve each of these as a separate attack. Instead, when

the titan attacks with its weapons, it rolls its attacks

normally (either one attack for a standard action, or four

as a full-round action) and hits every creature in its reach

each time an attack roll exceeds that creature's AC. If

any such attack roll results in a possible critical hit, the

critical is applied to one creature of the hekatonkheires's

choosing. The hekatonkheires can choose to deal

bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage as a free action

on each separate hit.

Planar Leap (Su) A hekatonkheires traverses the planes

by physically smashing through planar boundaries and

crashing devastatingly into the target plane itself. Once

per year as a full-round action, a hekatonkheires can,

as part of a jump, plane shift to any other plane (as per

the spell of the same name). It can only bring itself

and its gear when it travels in this manner. When the

hekatonkheires reaches its destination plane, it falls from

the sky and crashes to the ground, creating a devastating

explosion of thunder and fire. Any creature within 300 feet

of the point where the hekatonkheires lands (including the

titan itself ) takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and

20d6 points of sonic damage (Reflex DC 38 for half ). The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Stunning Slam (Ex) As a standard action, a hekatonkheires

may forgo any weapon attacks to make a single slam

attack against any creature in reach. If it hits, the target

takes damage and must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save

to avoid being stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is

Strength-based.

Horrifying abominations shunned by the gods immediately

upon their creation, the hekatonkheires are perhaps the

most powerful and devastating race of titans in existence.

When the titans-envious of the gods' divine strength-

rebelled against the deities, the hekatonkheires were

among the first to pick up arms, weary of the scorn their

own creators felt for them. The betrayal of the Elysian titans

led to the hekatonkheires' swift capture by the gods, who

found the hekatonkheires' power to be so immense that

they were not banished to the Abyss with their Thanatotic

brethren. Instead, the gods cast the hekatonkheires into the

furthest reaches of the multiverse they could find. There,

the hekatonkheires drifted in expanses of nothingness

for unknown eons, and the madness wrought upon them

by isolation destroyed their memories. Yet from their

madness these shattered monstrosities spawned progeny to

268

Illustration by Eric Belisle

replace them in their pursuit to destroy, and some of these

monstrous offspring discovered ways to break through

planar boundaries and wander the multiverse freely.

The gods initially created only three hekatonkheires,

seeking to make the ultimate warriors in order to guard

the gates to the Abyss. These three ancient titans still

drift in the unknown expanses between planes-the

hekatonkheires that now walk the worlds are their

lesser spawn. But these so-called "lesser" titans remain

almost unimaginably powerful themselves. They have

no knowledge of why their forgotten ancestors were

originally banished, and so they wander in search of

answers, all the while destroying entire worlds. They

are warped engines of mayhem, their existence based

wholly on the devastation of life and anything that

might remind them of their age-old war against the

gods, having inherited only the haunting ghosts of such

memories from their ancestors.

Those hekatonkheires who have emerged back into the

multiverse have done so in different realms, and to date, no

record of any two of these spawn meeting one another

exists. It is fortunate that only one hekatonkheires

is encountered on a world at any given time, as even

scholars cannot fathom the power that would arise

out of two or more of the titans' collective strength.

They traverse the planes alone, caring not for

allies of any sort until they can remember

what their purpose was when they were born

eons ago.

Though hekatonkheires are as intelligent

as the rest of their titan relatives, they wander

with such destructive and seemingly mindless

intentions that they spare no time in communicating

with other creatures, especially those that

would beg for mercy. The hekatonkheires

were created to destroy, and so that is all they

desire to do; the crushing blows of their

fists and the goring slashes of their

weapons speak for themselves. They

serve no master, and halt their otherwise endless

rampage only if called by their true names, which

few-if any-mortals know. Those that

do know these names speak them only in

whispers, for their mere utterance seems

to carry with it immeasurable power.

A hekatonkheires can only be called via mighty

spells such as gate if a conjurer knows the plane the

titan is currently on, and only if the conjurer knows the

true name of the hekatonkheires it is seeking to call. Only

the mad or depraved would dare such a feat, however, as

the might of one of these unique goliaths is so massive

that the being cannot be controlled, and even if it is

banished back to the realm from whence it came,

it is never long before the hekatonkheires sets its sights

on the world it visited so brief ly, if only to sate its lust for

destroying it.

Each hekatonkheires has 50 heads and 100 arms so that

one is never caught off guard. The stones that it hurls with

its 100 hands are as big as boulders, and those who have

seen a hekatonkheires hurl such rocks and lived to tell

the tale have said that it is as though an entire mountain

is falling from the sky. In addition to their unworldly

strength, hekatonkheires are known for their awesome

control over the powers of lightning and thunder, and an

individual hekatonkheires's arrival is often prefaced by an

abrupt and tumultuous storm in the area. Like all titans,

hekatonkheires are immortal, and do not die unless they

are slain.

A hekatonkheires is 50 feet tall and weighs 25 tons.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Ink Cloud (Ex) A tojanida can emit

a 30-foot-radius sphere of

ink once per minute as a

free action. The ink provides

total concealment in water,

and persists for 1 minute. If

used out of the water, the jet

of ink is a line 30 feet long, and

creatures in the area must succeed at

a DC 16 Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Tojanidas are bizarre natives from

the Plane of Water that resemble

mixes between monstrous crabs and

enormous snapping turtles. Originally

elemental beings of water, tojanidas

were bound into their strange forms

long ago for unclear reasons, and no

longer know how they might eventually

return to their pure and formless state. Determined

to preserve their pride, the grotesque tojanidas ply the

waters of the planes seeking hedonistic pleasures-

especially culinary ones-and the adoration of other

races. Loquacious when addressed with the proper

respect, they make excellent heralds and emissaries for

more powerful beings, and often enjoy posing as such

even when operating on their own. When riled, however,

tojanidas make fearsome opponents, violent and eager

juggernauts with snapping jaws and clacking pincers.

Adult tojanidas are roughly 6 feet long and weigh

several hundred pounds. When threatened, a tojanida can

retract its limbs most of the way into its shell, which is an

irremovable part of its body. The ring of eyes completely

encircling the tojanida's shell along its rim makes the

creature extremely difficult to catch by surprise. While

tojanidas adore eating, as they find f lavor and texture to

be two of the most fascinating senses, they don't actually

need to consume food, instead drawing sustenance

directly from the currents of arcane energy all around

them via the magic of their shells.

Blessed (some might say cursed) with extremely long

racial memories, tojanidas wander the oceans and lakes

of innumerable worlds, attempting to find unusual

physical pleasures or conversation capable of distracting

them from the insufferable ennui and apathy born of

remembering their ancestors' experiences. Though the

tojanidas themselves may not appreciate the burden of

memory, adventurers and scholars often seek the use of a

tojanida's recalled lore.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Conductive (Ex) Anytime a tophet is affected by

an effect that deals fire damage, determine

how much damage the construct would

have taken if it were not immune to fire.

Creatures currently swallowed whole

by the construct take fire damage

equal to half of this amount.

Swallow Whole (Ex) Once

swallowed by a tophet,

an opponent takes

no damage, but is

trapped inside

the creature's

hollow interior.

The construct's

maw locks down,

preventing creatures

from climbing back out.

A creature can attempt to

hack or smash its way out

as normal, but a tophet's

stomach has hit points equal

to one-tenth its actual hit

points plus its bonus hit

points for being a construct (totalling 40 hit points for most

tophets). Alternatively, a swallowed creature can attempt to

pick the lock on the iron hatch in the tophet's stomach by

making a DC 30 Disable Device check. If a creature exits by

picking the lock, the tophet closes its hatch and can swallow

whole again. These locks can also be picked from the

outside, but only after the tophet is slain. A

Known in some lands as furnace guards or iron gluttons,

tophets have long served in the palaces and prisons of

tyrants as vigilant sentinels and dreaded punishments.

Appearing as rotund iron statues, often bearing the

caricatured visages of past kings or dishonored nobles,

these constructs all possess yawning maws, capable of

easily gobbling up smaller creatures. Upon consuming

a victim, the animate statue becomes a walking prison,

holding its victim within with little chance for escape.

The iron statue can then return its victim to the proper

cell, the feet of its lord, or any other fate its creator

determines. In the most feared case, tophets capture or

are fed prisoners, then wander out into the desert heat

or even rivers of molten rock, where their interiors attain

hellish temperatures, torturing and often outright killing

those trapped within.

Tophets are often assembled in groups of up to a

dozen, where cruel rulers incarcerate traitors

and other criminals. Mindless creatures capable

only of obeying their masters' whims, these

unthinking constructs make incorruptible

guardians and are endlessly loyal.

Tophets stand 10 feet tall and

weigh 3,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

All-Seeing Attacks (Ex) A jotund troll can make nine additional

attacks of opportunity in a round, one for each head, although

no more than a single attack for any given opportunity.

Cacophonous Roar (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard

action, a jotund troll can emit a cacophonous roar from its

nine heads. All creatures within a 60-foot spread of the troll

must make a DC 19 Will save or become confused for 1d4

rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Multiple Minds (Ex) A jotund troll has nine different

minds that are in constant communication

with each other. The resulting jumble of

tangled thoughts grants the troll a

+4 racial bonus on all Will saving throws against mindaffecting

effects. In addition, whenever a jotund troll must

make a Will save, it can roll the saving throw twice and take

the better of the two results as its actual saving throw.

Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors. Prowling

frigid moors and marshes, these rapacious creatures have

the same insatiable appetites of common trolls but require

much more sustenance because of their excessive size.

Jotund trolls stand 30 feet tall and weigh roughly 25,000

pounds. They can live for up to 100 years.

The jotund troll's nine heads each have their own brains

and senses, but they share, after a fashion, the same mind.

Despite this, a jotund troll's heads often argue and bicker,

particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all

nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little

difference in such culinary disagreements.

Jotund trolls spawn with either their own kind or with

other trolls. In the latter case, there is only a 5% chance

the offspring will be a jotund troll. Apart from brief

mating periods, jotund trolls are solitary, although some

cull together bands of other giants into devastating war

parties that can lay waste to

entire regions.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Fear of Fire (Ex) A moss troll is shaken as long as it is within 30

feet of a visible fire or an open flame of at least torch size.

Tree Climber (Ex) When climbing trees and other foliage, a

moss troll's climb speed increases to 30 feet. If a moss troll

falls while climbing in trees, it ignores the first 30 feet it

falls for the purposes of calculating total damage from the

fall. While climbing in trees, a moss troll gains a +4 racial

bonus on initiative checks.

Moss trolls are bent and gangly creatures. They are

smaller and thinner than normal trolls, yet their arms are

unusually long and spindly for the creatures' size. Their

f lesh supports the growth of moss and mold as surely as

tree bark.

Although their appetites are notoriously powerful,

moss trolls are sly killers rather than simple brutes. They

travel in the trees, singing, climbing, and jumping with

unnerving ease. When a moss troll spots prey, it reaches

or leaps down from above, heedless of dropping great

distances in its eagerness to sate its ravenous appetite.

Moss trolls are fearless except in the face of fire, which

does not stop a hungry moss troll from attacking, but can

often cause a wounded one to retreat. However, those who

fight moss trolls may be unpleasantly surprised to learn

that acid has no special effect on a moss troll's regeneration.

Moss trolls not only hunt from the trees, but also live,

breed, and hide their treasure among the branches. Their

weirdly long arms allow them to attack foes on the ground

without ever needing to set foot on the earth themselves.

Young moss trolls are adept at climbing and acrobatics, as

much as they are at eating and killing. Like other trolls,

adult moss trolls often drive juveniles away after training

them to hunt and fight. Gangs and troops of moss trolls

exist only where food is plentiful. While moss trolls can

digest almost any organic material, they prefer fresh

meat-particularly when said meat is served still alive

and squirming after a particularly invigorating session of

stalking and torture.

A moss troll is 9 feet tall and weighs 550 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Disease (Ex) A trollhound's saliva is an infectious brew of

contagion. Creatures bitten by a trollhound are often

afflicted with bloodfire fever, a disease characterized by

deep internal pain, as if the victim's blood were on fire.

Additional symptoms include loss of muscular coordination,

pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Trolls

and trollhounds alike are immune to bloodfire fever, even

though trollhounds often exhibit the pus-filled blisters

that come with the disease.

Bloodfire fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14;

onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Str

damage, 1d3 Dex damage, and target is

fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves. The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Slavering and voracious, trollhounds

seem to be trolls in smaller canine

form, and indeed, are often found

as pets among gangs and tribes

of trolls. Requiring vast

amounts of food to

fuel their regenerative

metabolisms, packs of

wild trollhounds range

far and wide through the

mountains of the north, their ravenous hunger driving

them to hunt and consume any prey they can track down

and kill.

A typical trollhound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder,

has short but powerful legs, and weighs around 350

pounds. A trollhound's skin is somewhat scaly, with

patches of rough, greenish-black fur. It has oversized jaws

with a pronounced underbite, and its eyes are normally a

dull, hateful orange.

Trollhounds are believed to be the outcome of infusing

particularly ferocious worgs with alchemically prepared

troll blood. The resulting beast loses the worg's wicked

intelligence but gains the ability to regenerate even the

most grievous wounds, except those inf licted by fire or

acid. Whatever their origin, trollhounds breed true and

are often raised by trolls.

Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat,

relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them

through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel

them, as the beasts are too dull to recognize the danger it

poses. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools

in combating trollhounds, and canny hunters know to

burn every last remnant of a slain trollhound, for as is

true of trolls, even the smallest piece of trollhound f lesh

can eventually regrow back into a full-sized beast.

Trollhounds are most often found in the company of

trolls, who breed the beasts as hunters, guards, pets, and

food. Trollhounds seem to have an affinity for their savage

masters, and tamed trollhounds always regard trolls as

alpha members of the pack. A trollhound will never attack

a troll without cause-although trolls often enjoy violent

roughhousing with these creatures nonetheless.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Scrimshaw Magic (Sp) When a tupilaq is created, its

creator can inscribe a single spell he knows

(as long as that spell is no higher than

2nd level and requires no material

components) into the tupilaq as

a complex scrimshaw design.

The tupilaq gains the ability to

use that spell as a spell-like ability

(CL 7th) three times per day. The

tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new

spell onto the tupilaq if he wishes,

replacing the previous

scrimshaw. Inscribing a

new scrimshaw requires

24 hours of work and

an expenditure of 500 gp

in materials. The tupilaq presented here

utilizes invisibility in this manner. Erase

can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it

fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a

tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses

access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out

its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes

the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a

tupilaq's creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out

the nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight,

continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.

Seek Target (Su) A tupilaq's creator can place a drop of blood, lock

of hair, or other portion of a creature's body in the tupilaq's

maw as a standard action. From that point on, the tupilaq

constantly knows what direction that creature is located in,

and gains a +20 insight bonus on all Perception checks made

to locate the creature. A new target cannot be assigned to a

tupilaq in this manner until its previous target is dead.

Shearing Jaws (Ex) All tupilaqs are crafted with oversized jaws

capable of tearing and pulling. A tupilaq applies twice its

Strength modifier to damage with a successful bite attack and

threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A tupilaq is treated as

Large for all checks made to move a grappled opponent.

Tupilaqs are small constructs crafted out of whale bones

and whale teeth for the sole purpose of murdering the

creator's enemies. A tupilaq's appearance can vary based

on its construction, but all have prominent jaws and a

small body with hands and feet fit for swimming. A tupilaq

usually stands 3 feet tall and weighs only 30 pounds.

Tupilaqs must be created in secrecy-if any other

person discovers the tupilaq is being created, the attempt

to build the construct immediately fails. As part of its

creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit to

possess the tupilaq. Most often, the animus of a tupilaq

is that of a dead child or other small humanoid, and the

parity of size between the new vessel and the spirit's

previous body is what gives the creature a speed and

agility on land and in water that is atypical for

most constructs. This trapped spirit is also what

makes a tupilaq so savage and murderous.

CONSTRUCTION

A tupilaq is built from 30 pounds of

whale bones, bound together

with sinew. When the

creature's creation is

complete, the sinew falls

away and the bones fuse

together to create the

animated creature.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Eclipse (Su) Anytime a tzitzimitl casts deeper darkness, any

creatures in the area of darkness when it is created take 8d6

points of cold damage (DC 31 Fortitude for half). Any creature

that takes damage from this effect becomes staggered as

long as it remains in the area of darkness and for 1d4 rounds

after it leaves that area. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Eye Beam (Su) As a standard action, a tzitzimitl can fire a

glowing beam of force from its eyes at a range of 100 feet as

a ranged touch attack dealing 10d6 points of force damage

and 10d6 points of electricity damage.

Light to Dark (Su) As an immediate action up to three times

per day, a tzitzimitl can convert a positive energy effect that

affects it into negative energy. Doing so transforms the

entire effect, such that it affects other creatures as well. A

tzitzimitl can transform channeled positive energy in this way

even if the positive energy would not otherwise harm it.

Enigmatic creatures of darkness, some cultures

claim tzitzimitls attack and consume entire suns

to "shut down worlds" in preparation for the

end of days. Sages say that these creatures come

from the cold, dark places between the stars,

and that in the darkness of any eclipse,

one can see their immense, worlddarkening

shadows.

Some claim ancient and forgotten

deities of death and destruction created

the first tzitzimitls as instruments of

apocalypse, while others speculate

they come from faraway worlds

where immense planets teem with

creatures of this scale, and that the

immortal dead of these dark globes

are banished to other worlds to

spread devastation.

Tzitzimitls as a whole

offer neither affirmation

nor denial for these

claims, and in fact

seem to glory in such

legends. Certainly, the

arrival of a tzitzimitl upon a world

heralds the advent of a time of great

trouble, although whether or not the

tzitzimitl actually presages such

dark times or is the cause of them is

a matter of debate. On some planets,

tzitzimitls have already arrived, yet

they lie dormant in ancient tombs,

imprisoned ages ago by heroes

who are long forgotten today.

A tzitzimitl is 50 feet tall.

ECOLOGY

Organization solitary or ride (2-8 valkyries)

Treasure triple (+2 breastplate, +2 returning spear, other treasure)

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Battle Trained (Ex) A valkyrie is proficient with all armor.

Armor never impacts a valkyrie's speed, nor does a

valkyrie take armor check penalties on Ride checks.

Choose the Slain (Su) A valkyrie can draw the

soul from a newly dead body and store it in

her spear for transport to the Outer Planes.

This functions as soul bind, but the dead

creature must be willing to have its soul

taken. If the creature is unwilling, this

ability has no effect.

Holy Zeal (Su) A valkyrie adds her

Charisma modifier as a deflection

bonus to her Armor Class.

Valkyries are outsiders who scour the battlefields of

the Material Plane for warriors of great prowess and

legendary renown. With a glance, a valkyrie can tell who

is near death and ready to give up life and who fights on

to live another day, and can either claim the soul of the

slain or aid the living to continue the fight.

Valkyries are always female, and appear as strong and

beautiful human, dwarven, or elven women. A human

valkyrie is 6 feet tall and weighs close to 200 pounds.

Valkyries serve a variety of deities, though they are

most often associated with the gods of war, conf lict, valor,

and courage. Although capable combatants in their own

right, valkyries are almost always encountered mounted,

typically on f lying steeds such as dragon horses, pegasi,

or sleipnirs.

Jiang-shis (often known as "hopping vampires") are undead

humanoid creatures that feed on the exhaled life energy of

the living. A jiang-shi's appearance is based on the state of the

creature's corpse at the time of its reanimation. Regardless

of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or armor

that is at least one generation out of style. Additionally,

each has a short parchment prayer scroll affixed to its brow

by stitches; originally intended to protect the body from

restless spirits, this scroll grants a jiang-shi immunity to

magical effects unleashed by items like scrolls and wands.

A jiang-shi is created when a restless spirit does not

leave its corpse at the time of death, and is instead allowed

to fester and putrefy within. At some point during the

body's decomposition, the thing rises in its grotesque

form and seeks living creatures to feed upon.

CREATING A JIANG-SHI

"Jiang-shi" is an acquired template that can be added

to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred

to hereafter as the base creature). Most jiang-shis were

once humans, but any creature that undergoes specific

rites can acquire the template. A jiang-shi uses the base

creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as the base creature +2.

Alignment: Any evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented).

Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.

Senses: A jiang-shi vampire gains darkvision 60 feet.

It also gains the ability to sense the breathing of living

creatures-a jiang-shi has blindsight to a range of 60 feet

against creatures that breathe. A creature may hold its breath

to prevent a jiang-shi from noticing it in this manner.

Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +2.

Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit

Dice are unaffected. As undead, jiang-shis use their

Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points

(instead of Constitution).

Defensive Abilities: A jiang-shi gains channel

resistance +4, DR 10/magic and slashing, and resistance

to cold 20, in addition to all of the defensive abilities

granted by the undead type. A jiang-shi also gains fast

healing 5. In addition, all jiang-shis gain the following

defensive ability.

Prayer Scroll (Su): The scroll attached to the brow of

a jiang-shi grants immunity to any effects generated

from spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items,

such as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat

the jiang-shi as if it had unbeatable spell resistance. A

jiang-shi's prayer scroll can be removed with a successful

steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322),

which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to

these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed (a

standard action), the vampire also loses its fast healing

ability. A jiang-shi may create a replacement prayer scroll

by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument,

but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.

Weaknesses: Jiang-shis recoil from mirrors or the sound of

handbells rung within 10 feet of them. Cooked rice, which

to jiang-shis mocks the fundamental fact that they no

longer eat food, shames them into recoiling as well. These

things don't harm a jiang-shi vampire-they merely keep

278

Illustration by Eva Widermann

it at bay for a period of time. A recoiling jiang-shi vampire

must stay at least 5 feet away from the object of its revulsion,

and cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature

brandishing the object during that round. Holding a

jiang-shi vampire at bay takes a standard action. After being

held at bay for 1 round, a jiang-shi vampire can attempt to

overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally

each round it makes a DC 20 Will save at the start of its turn.

Destroying a Jiang-Shi: If reduced to 0 hit points, a jiangshi

vampire crumbles to dust but is not destroyed. It

reforms in 1 minute with 1 hit point in the same space, or

the nearest unoccupied space. Scattering the dust before

the jiang-shi reforms destroys it permanently, as does

mixing rice into the dust with a dose of holy water. Jiangshi

vampires are also susceptible to wooden weapons

carved from peach trees, as such weapons represent the

unity of all elements and life to these creatures. A wooden

weapon carved from a peach tree automatically bypasses

a jiang-shi vampire's damage reduction. Additionally, any

successful hit from such a weapon that reduces a jiang-shi

to 0 hit points immediately destroys the creature.

Although they normally retreat from daylight,

jiang-shi vampires are not destroyed by

sunlight like regular vampires and can move

around during the day without harm.

Speed: A jiang-shi moves only by hopping. This

mode of movement is somewhat less swift than regular

movement, and thus a jiang-shi's base speed is reduced by

10 feet from the base creature's speed, to a minimum of 10

feet. This unusual mode of movement allows the jiangshi

to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement,

and makes it impossible to trip. Other speeds (like f ly or

swim speeds) are not affected by this reduction.

Melee: A jiang-shi gains a bite attack and 2 claw attacks

if the base creature didn't have them. Damage for the bite

attack depends on the jiang-shi's size, but its claw attacks

do damage as a creature two size categories larger. For a

Medium jiang-shi, a bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage

and a claw attack deals 1d8 points of damage. A jiang-shi's

claws are even more dangerous than this, though-see the

"brutal claws" special attack below. A jiang-shi's natural

weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction.

Special Attacks: A jiang-shi gains several special attacks.

Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the jiang-shi's Hit Dice + the

jiang-shi's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.

Brutal Claws (Ex): A jiang-shi's nails are brutally sharp

and can extend and retract at will. They threaten a critical

hit on a roll of 19-20 and grant the grab ability. A jiangshi

with monk levels gains this enhanced critical threat

range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses

its unarmed monk damage or its claw damage, whichever

is higher, when making such attacks.

Drain Chi (Su): Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi

vampire drains "chi," or life energy, from a victim's breath.

When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in

addition to any other effects caused by a successful check,

including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt

to drain chi by drinking the victim's breath. The victim

can resist this attack by making a successful Fortitude

save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and

is staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Ability Scores: Str +4, Dex +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +2. As

an undead creature, a jiang-shi has no Constitution score.

Feats: Jiang-shis gain Alertness, Dodge, Mobility, Skill

Focus (Acrobatics), and Spring Attack as bonus feats.

Skills: Jiang-shis gain a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics,

Perception, and Stealth checks.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Prehensile Tail (Ex) All vanaras have long, flexible tails that they

can use to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with

their tails, but the tails do allow them to retrieve small stowed

objects carried on their persons as a swift action.

Vanaras are intelligent, simian humanoids who live in

deep forests and jungles. They are both agile and clever, but

saddled with boundless curiosity and a love of pranks that,

while normally harmless, hinder ingratiations with those

they encounter. A vanara's body is covered in a thin coat

of soft fur, and individuals with chestnut, ivory, and even

golden coats are common. Despite its fur, a vanara can grow

lengthy hair on its head just like a human, and both male

and female vanaras take pains to wear elaborate hairstyles

for important social functions. The hair on a vanara's

head matches the color of its fur. All vanaras have long,

prehensile tails and handlike feet capable of well-articulated

movements. A vanara stands slightly shorter than a typical

human. Males weigh from 150 to 200 pounds at most, with

females weighing slightly less. Vanaras live for 60 to 75 years.

Vanaras live in large, tree-top villages connected by

rope-bridges and ladders. Homes are carved out of trees

but usually left open to the elements except for woven leaf

canopies and overhangs. Vanara villages are typically led by

the community's religious leader-usually a cleric,

oracle, or monk.

VANARA

CHARACTERS

Vanaras are defined by

their class levels-they do

not possess racial Hit Dice. All vanaras have the following

racial traits.

+2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma: Vanaras are

agile and insightful, but are also rather mischievous.

Climb Speed: Vanaras have a climb speed of 20 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Vanaras can see twice as far as a

human in conditions of dim light.

Nimble: Vanaras have a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics

and Stealth checks.

Prehensile Tail: See above.

Languages: A vanara begins play speaking both

Common and Vanaran. Vanaras with high Int

scores can choose from among the following

bonus languages: Aklo, Celestial, Elven,

Gnome, Goblin, and Sylvan.

Poison Use (Ex) Vishkanyas are skilled

with poison and never accidentally

poison themselves when using or

applying poison.

Toxic (Ex) A number of times per

day equal to its Constitution

modifier (minimum 1/day),

a vishkanya can envenom

a weapon that it wields

with its toxic saliva or

blood (using blood

requires the vishkanya

to be injured when

it uses this ability).

Applying venom

in this way is a

swift action.

Vishkanya Venom: Injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the

vishkanya's Hit Dice + the vishkanya's Constitution modifier;

frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.

Vishkanyas are a race of exotic humanoids known for their

guile and affinity for poisons of all kinds. A vishkanya's

f lesh is made up of fine scales that from a distance of even

a few feet look just like particularly smooth skin. These

scales are usually a single dark color, although some of

them have complex patterns like stripes or even spirals.

A vishkanya's tongue is forked like a serpent's tongue, and

its eyes lack visible pupils.

Although legends abound that the merest touch from

a vishkanya can slay a mortal humanoid, these tales are

patently false. A vishkanya's skin is no more poisonous

than that of any human, but it is true that their blood, spit,

and other bodily f luids can be dangerous. Vishkanyas are

skilled in using their own spittle or even their blood to

envenom their weapons, and those who fight them should

be wary of exposure to the vishkanya's poison. A

vishkanya is 6 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.

VISHKANYA CHARACTERS

Vishkanyas are defined by their class levels-

they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Vishkanyas

have the following racial traits.

+2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma,

-2 Wisdom: Vishkanyas are

graceful and elegant, but

often irrational.

Low-Light Vision:

Vishkanyas can see twice as far as

humans in conditions of dim light.

Keen Senses: Vishkanyas receive a

Poison Resistance: A vishkanya

has a racial bonus on saves against

poison equal to its Hit Dice.

Poison Use: See above.

Toxic: See above.

Weapon Familiarity:

Vishkanyas are always

prof icient with blowguns,

kukri, and shuriken.

Languages: Vishkanyas begin

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Suffocating Water (Su) Once per day as a standard action,

a vodyanoi can cause the water surrounding it up to

a radius of 30 feet to grow thick and slimy, making it

difficult for water-breathing creatures within the area

other than vodyanois to breathe. A vodyanoi can control

narrow currents of breathable water to provide oxygen to

up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect-vodyanois

themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures

in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath

or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating

water does not move-it persists for a number of

minutes equal to the vodyanoi's Hit Dice. The slimy

water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in

any significant manner. A creature can make

a DC 20 Perception check to notice the

difference between suffocating water and

any normal water that may surround it.

Vodyanois resemble humanoid salamanders. They have

short noses, bulging eyes, and broad mouths covered

with thickets of f leshy tendrils. Skin color varies wildly

depending on the climate and terrain, from drab greens

and grays to vibrant oranges and reds. Vodyanois stand

roughly 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds.

They can live up to 120 years.

Vodyanois are well known as enemies to boggards-

another amphibious race often encountered in proximity to

vodyanoi lands. While vodyanois themselves are rarely evil,

they are capricious and often quick to anger, particularly

when they feel their territories have been intruded upon.

Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their

anger-a vodyanoi who suspects one of boggard collusion

will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity

to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and

when visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary

(such as when one might need to seek out a vodyanoi for aid

in curing a disease), gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits

are highly recommended.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Blood-Freezing Howl (Su) As a standard action, a voonith

can unleash a bloodcurdling howl. All creatures within

a 30-foot-radius burst must succeed at a DC 15 Will

save or become dazed for 1 round and then shaken for

an additional 1d6 rounds. Any creature that makes a

successful save against a voonith's howl is immune to the

same voonith's howl for 24 hours. This is a sonic mindaffecting

fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Cunning and aggressive, vooniths are amphibious

nocturnal predators with voracious appetites and mild

intelligence. A voonith's howl is said to freeze the blood

and is more than capable of stopping a creature in its

tracks. Vooniths usually howl when they see prey too

far away from the water's edge to ambush. While the

vooniths are native to the strange Dimension of Dream,

many have found their way out of that realm and into

the waking world to take up lairs in the swampy fens

and remote coastlines of the world. How the vooniths

originally managed to make this transition between

worlds is unclear.

Although they look like little more than wild beasts,

vooniths are actually rather intelligent. While certainly

not as sharp as the average human, a voonith is smart

enough to know how to speak and often does so with others

of its kind. Vooniths do not often choose to communicate

with other creatures, giving rise to the misconception that

they're little more than dumb animals, but on occasion,

travelers in swampy regions tell tales of overhearing

strange piping voices speaking among the reeds. Those few

who know the secrets of the Aklo tongue can understand

these words, although understanding of what the vooniths

whisper in the night when they think no one else can hear

is not always for the best.

While not evil, vooniths have a decidedly dark sense

of humor, and take great pleasure in concocting violent

poems or grisly jokes. Punch lines in which non-voonith

creatures-particularly humans, cats, and gnomes-

meet gory and ironic fates are the most entertaining to

vooniths. Some tales speak of canny travelers who, with the

ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up unlikely

conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth,

vooniths are quite social, and when one breeches

the awkwardness arising from interspecies

conf lict, a friendship with a voonith can

be an unexpected reward. Vooniths who

befriend travelers often escort them,

quietly and unseen, through dangerous

bogs, and when such travelers fall prey

to other dangers of the swamp, a friendly

voonith will provide what aid it can.

Vooniths are 4 feet long and weigh

70 pounds, yet rumors tell of

vooniths that have grown

to much larger sizes

than this.

Though related to raptors and other birds of prey, vultures

mainly feed on carrion they spot or scent from on high.

Vultures have weak claws compared to predatory birds, but

their sharp and wickedly hooked beaks tear living f lesh as

readily as the sharpest blade.

Despite dining on carrion, vultures prefer their corpses

newly dead rather than rotten. Some even

hunt smaller prey when food is scarce.

A wickedly hooked beak and an immense bald head draw

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Diseased (Ex) Due to their filthy eating habits and constant

exposure to decaying flesh, giant vultures are harbingers

of disease-much more so than the standard vulture. Any

creature bitten by a giant vulture has a 10% chance of being

exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease

(Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, a victim

can no longer be infected by this particular giant vulture,

though attacks by different giant vultures are resolved

normally and may result in multiple illnesses. While

vultures aren't immune to all diseases, they do gain a +4

racial bonus on all saving throws against such ailments.

Larger even than condors, giant vultures dwell only in

regions where carrion is both large and plentiful, such as the

primeval wildernesses where megafauna roam. They also

f lock to regions torn by war, feasting on the dead with no

concern for allegiance or race. Giant vultures rarely wait for

wounded creatures to finish dying before they feed, and are

much braver than most wild animals. A giant vulture, for

example, wouldn't think twice about swooping down on a

heavily armored column of soldiers just to snatch up a few

wounded stragglers from the end of the line.

A giant vulture stands more than 13 feet tall, has a

wingspan of over 30 feet, and weighs 500 to 600 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Corpse Lure (Ex) By setting a corpse atop its stump and

riddling the body with small, extruded

filaments, a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing

can crudely maneuver the corpse,

manipulating it like a puppet. The corpse

cannot leave the stump or perform

complex actions, but is instead used

to lure larger prey within range of the

wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's tentacles. The

largest corpse a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing

can manipulate in this fashion is two size

categories smaller than itself (thus Tiny

creatures for a


	SIZE:M


	wolf-insheep's-

clothing). When a

wolf-in-sheep's-clothing

uses a corpse like this,

it gains a +8 bonus on

Disguise checks beyond

its normal racial bonus.

Implant (Ex) A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can infest a creature

with its eggs in one of two ways. A creature that eats a carcass

used by the monster as a corpse lure automatically becomes

implanted. Alternatively, up to once per day, a wolf-insheep's-

clothing can implant an egg into a helpless or pinned

creature as part of a grapple action. The target can resist being

implanted with a DC 19 Fortitude save, but if it fails, the seed

gestates and becomes a self-aware creature that slowly steals

nourishment from its host before finally exploding free of its

host's gut. The parasite can be cut free of the host's belly with

a DC 25 Heal check, which takes 1 hour and deals 3d6 slashing

damage regardless of success or failure. Remove disease (or any

similar effect) also kills an implanted egg.

Wolf-in-Sheep's-Clothing Egg: Infestation-ingestion;

save Fort 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str

damage until host reaches 0, then 3d6 damage as parasite

bursts free; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing appears at first to be little more

than a tree stump sitting in a clearing, perhaps with a

small animal sitting atop it. Only when a predator comes

close does it become clear that the small animal is in fact

long dead, given false life by tendrils springing up through

its form, but by then it's too late, as the wolf-in-sheep'sclothing

drags the would-be hunter into its waiting maw.

Though intelligent, these monsters see little need for

the company of others. Their method of reproduction is

as hideous as their tactic of using corpses as lures, for

they implant their parasitic eggs in living hosts, giving

their spawn a fresh meal to eat upon hatching.

A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is usually about 4 to 5 feet

across and weighs 200 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Amnesia (Su) Once per day as a

standard action, a yithian can

attempt to inflict amnesia

on a target it is able

to communicate

telepathically with. A

target can resist this

attack with a DC 21 Will save. If the target fails its save, it

takes a permanent -4 penalty on Will saving throws and

all skill checks, and loses all memories save for those the

yithian chooses to leave intact. This effect can be cured by

heal or greater restoration. This is a mind-affecting insanity

effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Deadly Pincers (Ex) A yithian always applies 1-1/2 times its

Strength modifier to damage dealt by its pincer attacks,

and deals triple damage on a critical hit. Pincers are primary

attacks for yithians.

Mind Swap (Su) As a full-round action, a yithian can trade

minds with another living creature it is able to communicate

telepathically with. This functions as magic jar, except the

two minds trade bodies. An unwilling target can resist the

mind swap with a DC 21 Will save, after which that particular

yithian cannot attempt to swap minds with that creature

again for 24 hours. The yithian can end the effect of this mind

swap at any time and over any distance as a full-round action,

instantly returning both minds to the proper bodies-if the

yithian wishes, it may attempt to use its amnesia power

on the other mind as a free action when it ends the

mind swap in this way. This is a mind-affecting effect.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Scholar (Ex) Yithians treat all

knowledge skills as class skills.

Untold eons ago, the yithians

inhabited a dying world.

To escape their doomed planet, they

cast their minds through time and

space, eventually coming to rest in the

strange, alien bodies they possess today. While

these strange beings now reside in

a distant galaxy, the yithians

make use of their ability

to astrally project to

explore other planets,

eager to find new

worlds to explore.

When a yithian

arrives upon a new

world, it often swaps

minds with the creatures

it encounters there so as to experience

that world as if it were a native. Those

who spend time in a yithian's body

rarely tell of the strange times

they have experienced, for yithians

guard themselves well, and leave

those they use in this

manner amnesiacs who

remember the truth only

as fragmentary nightmares.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Chilling Touch (Su) A yuki-onna's

touch causes 4d6 cold damage.

Whenever a creature takes

cold damage in this

manner, it must make a

DC 20 Fortitude save to

avoid being staggered

by the supernatural

cold for 1 round. This duration

stacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Fascinating Gaze (Su) Fascinated for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Will

DC 20 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Snow Dependency (Ex) A yuki-onna is staggered if she is

ever in an area without snow while her snowstorm aura is

suppressed or otherwise not functioning.

Snowstorm (Su) A yuki-onna is surrounded by whirling blasts

of snow, even in areas that wouldn't allow for such weather,

that comprise a 200-foot-radius spread. Within this area, the

snowfall and wind gusts cause a -4 penalty on Perception

checks and ranged attacks. The wind itself blows in a

clockwise rotation around the yuki-onna, and functions as

severe wind (Core Rulebook 439). A yuki-onna is unaffected by

snowstorms or blizzards of any kind. Any effect that causes

these winds to drop below severe (such as control weather or

control winds) cancels the snowstorm effect entirely.

A yuki-onna is the restless spirit of a woman who froze

to death in the snow and was never given a proper burial.

She roams the wilderness, constantly searching

for intelligent creatures to kill and always

appearing surrounded by swirling mists of

snow and ice. Eternally jaded by her unjust

departure to the afterlife, a yuki-onna seeks

to impose the same cruel fate upon those

who still live, particularly men and

those who sympathize or cooperate

with them. Many foolish individuals

are lured to their deaths by a yukionna's

unparalleled beauty, which

remains even as the evil spirit

steadily freezes and kills her

victims with her powers over frost.

The transition from life

to undeath corrupts a yukionna's

soul, and even a wellintentioned,

good-hearted

individual who freezes in

the snow may become a

treacherous yuki-onna. Most

yuki-onnas immediately seek

out those who wronged them

in life, after which they reside

in an area near what was their

home, haunting and killing

anyone who dares to come near.

Yuki-onnas hardly ever make their

presences known in rural areas with larger

populations, and they prefer inhabiting

the countryside and wilderness.

When a yuki-onna is destroyed, her body

melts as though ice, leaving only a small

pool of water in its stead. A yuki-onna is 5-1/2

feet tall.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Otherworldly Touch (Ex) A zoog's natural attacks can strike incorporeal creatures as if they were ghost touch weapons.

Spell Sight (Su) A zoog's eyes radiate normal light

in a 15-foot cone and increase the light level by

one step for an additional 15 feet beyond that area.

Any magic effect in this area glows faintly. This glow

does not reveal the magic effect's school or strength. A

zoog can quell or renew this light as a swift action.

Spiteful, nasty creatures with a taste for the f lesh of

sentient beings, zoogs lurk in the shadowy, moldering

places of the world. Often mistaken merely for

otherworldly animals, zoogs possess base intentions

and vicious demeanors that set them apart from lowly

beasts. Congregating in loose, tribal societies, these

sinister creatures claim the depths of dark woodlands or

moldy forests as their homes, favoring lands where the

boundaries between worlds and planes grow thin and

strange creatures-not unlike themselves-slip between

reality's cracks.

Although lone zoogs shy away from attacking larger

creatures, when zoogs outnumber an invader they launch

deadly ambushes, leaping from sagging boughs and

hidden dens to swarm foes. Only strangers with quick

tongues and items that appeal to zoogs' interest in magical

curiosities might manage to barter for safe passage

through zoog territory. While many victims of zoog attacks

are consumed on the spot, some less fortunate few are

dragged back to the mystical, strangely carved stones that

mark the center of zoog communities. There, such captives

become the doomed focus of strange ceremonies before

being sacrificed to the zoogs' depraved deities.

Commonly, zoogs eat fungi and plants, but they also

have a taste for the meat of sentient creatures, treating

the butchering and consumption of such beings as a rare

privilege. Zoogs also detest cats, and go to great lengths to

slay felines of any sort and devour them.

Occasionally a zoog allows a spellcaster of especial

depravity, or with interests in the mysteries of realms and

creatures beyond the mortal world, to employ it as a familiar.

A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be

chaotic neutral, and have an arcane caster level of 5th or

higher to gain a zoog familiar.

Corpse Call (Su) Zuvembies cannot speak, but their strange calls and whistles captivate the minds of those who hear them. Once per day, a zuvembie may call out, and all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within a 100-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or move toward the zuvembie using the most direct means possible. If this path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the zuvembie simply stands and offers no resistance to the zuvembie's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the zuvembie continues its call as a standard action each round. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect, and has no effect on deaf creatures. The save DC is Charisma-based. Tied to the dark forces of nature and unholy magic, zuvembies employ fear and the wild creatures of the land to take their vengeance upon the living. Zuvembies appear to be withered, animate corpses but possess ruthless minds and blasphemous vigor. Revenge fuels a zuvembie, a hatefulness directed toward those who wronged it in life. Yet even when the last one who maligned it lies dead, its rage remains, turning against all who live, especially the relatives of the target of its original hate. Most zuvembies willingly performed the vile rituals to attain vengeance through unlife, but the transformation can also be wrought upon a helpless victim. The method of transforming into a zuvembie involves the creation and consumption of a vial of oil of animate dead, plus the performance of additional dark rites that take a day to perform and cost 3,000 gp. The ritual kills the target, who must make a DC 20 Will save. Failure results in the victim's death, while success means it reanimates as a free-willed zuvembie..
