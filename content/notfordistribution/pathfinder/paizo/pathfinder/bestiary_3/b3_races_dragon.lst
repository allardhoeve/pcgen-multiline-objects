Dragon, Imperial

Although chromatic and metallic dragons are the most

widely known, other categories of true dragon exist.

Presented here are the f ive imperial dragons, regal

guardians of ancient lands and servants of cosmic balance.

AGE CATEGORIES

Many of a true dragon's abilities, attacks, and other statistics

improve as the dragon grows older. These increases are divided

into 12 age categories-as a dragon ages, its base statistics

change as noted on the Dragon Age Categories table.

Age Category: This is the age category's name.

Age in Years: This is the dragon's actual age.

CR: This column modifies the dragon's base CR.

Size: This column shows the number of size categories

to increase the dragon's base size by, depending on its age

(from


	SIZE:T


	to Small,


	SIZE:S


	to Medium, and so on). A true

dragon does not gain the standard increases to ability

scores when it achieves a larger size-instead, true dragons

gain ability score increases according to their age category,

as indicated on the Dragon Ability Scores table.

Hit Dice: This shows how many additional Hit Dice a

dragon gains over its base Hit Dice as it grows. Increases

to Hit Dice grant extra hit points, feats, and skill ranks

as well as increasing the dragon's base attack bonus and

base save bonuses. A dragon has skill ranks equal to 6 + its

Intelligence modifier per Hit Die. A dragon's increases to

ability scores for gaining Hit Dice are included in the total

ability score increases (see the Dragon Ability Scores table).

Natural Armor: This shows the amount the dragon's base

natural armor bonus increases by with each age category.

Breath Weapon: Each dragon has a breath weapon (see

Combat) that deals a base amount of damage. This multiplier

increases the number of dice of damage dealt by the dragon's

breath weapon. For example, a mature adult dragon with a base

breath weapon that deals 2d6 points of acid damage would

deal 14d6 points of acid damage (due to the ?7 multiplier).

COMBAT

The Dragon Attacks and Speeds table lists the attacks

a dragon can employ and the damage it deals (a dash

indicates a dragon of that size does not possess that natural

attack). Dragons gain other abilities described here when

they reach a specific age category.

Fly Speed: A dragon's f ly speed increases as indicated,

according to its size. Imperial dragons are wingless and

their f light is a supernatural ability.

Bite: This is a primary attack that deals the indicated

damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus

(even though it has more than one attack). A dragon's bite

attack has reach as if the creature were one size category

larger (+10 feet for


	SIZE:C


	dragons).

Claws: These primary attacks deal the indicated damage

plus the dragon's Strength bonus.

Gore: As they are wingless,


	SIZE:M


	and larger imperial

dragons make gore attacks with their horns instead of wing

attacks. A gore is a primary attack that deals the indicated

damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. An

imperial dragon's gore attack has reach as if the creature were

one size category larger (+10 feet for


	SIZE:C


	dragons).

Tail Slap: The dragon can slap one foe each round with its

tail. A tail slap is a secondary attack that deals the indicated

damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (this is

an exception to the normal secondary attack rules).

Crush (Ex): A flying or jumping


	SIZE:H


	or larger dragon can

land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush

them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three

or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack

affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures

in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to

that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically

taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the

dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the

pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal.

Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they

don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus

1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.

Tail Sweep (Ex): This allows a


	SIZE:G


	or larger dragon

to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects

a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal

dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the

dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept

area are affected if they are four or more size categories

smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals

the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength

bonus. Affected creatures can attempt Ref lex saves to take half

damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon).

Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard

action. A dragon can use its breath weapon once every 1d4

rounds, even if it possesses more than one breath weapon.

A breath weapon always starts at an intersection adjacent to

the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Breath weapons come in two shapes, lines and cones, whose

areas vary with the dragon's size. If a breath weapon deals

damage, those caught in the area can attempt Ref lex saves

to take half damage. The save DC against a breath weapon is

10 + 1/2 the dragon's HD + the dragon's Con modifier. Saves

against various breath weapons use the same DC; the type of

saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. A dragon can

use its breath weapon when it is grappling or being grappled.

ADDITIONAL DRAGON RULES

Dragon Senses (Ex): Dragons have darkvision 120 feet

and blindsense 60 feet. They see four times as well as a

human in dim light and twice as well in normal light.

92

Frightful Presence (Ex): A dragon's frightful presence

has a range equal to 30 feet ? the dragon's age category,

but otherwise functions as detailed in the universal

monster rules in the appendix.

Spells: A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a

sorcerer of the level indicated in its specific description.

Its caster level depends on its age, as shown for each type.

Spell-Like Abilities: A dragon's caster level for its

spell-like abilities is equal to its total Hit Dice.

Damage Reduction: Dragons gain damage reduction

as they age, as indicated in each dragon's specific entry.

Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Immunities (Ex): Every dragon is immune to sleep

effects and paralysis effects. In addition, a dragon is

immune to one or more additional forms of attack or

energy damage no matter what its age, as given in its

specif ic description.

Spell Resistance (Ex): As dragons grow older, they

become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities,

as indicated in the specif ic dragon descriptions. A

dragon's SR is equal to 11 + its CR.

forest dragon uses its breath weapon, it can summon a

greater earth elemental within the cone. The caster level for

these effects is the same as the dragon's caster level.

mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful

Bluff check against the listener's Sense Motive check.

Stony Death (Su) Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points

by a great wyrm forest dragon's breath weapon must also

make a Fortitude save (same DC as the forest dragon's

Infused with the power of waves and storms, sea dragons-

or jiaolungs, as they are known in many lands-are draconic

protectors of oceans and their creatures. Possessing

tempestuous natures, sea dragons wander widely, sometimes

claiming thousands of miles

of ocean and coastlines

as their protectorates.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Borne Aloft (Su) Old or younger sky dragons fly with good

maneuverability while all older sky dragons have perfect.

Celestial Emissary (Su) Three times per day, a great wyrm sky

dragon can imbue others with the celestial aspect of the

oracle spell divine vessel*, but it can only be cast on another

willing creature of good alignment.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older sky dragon can assume any

humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.

Cloud Sight (Su) A very young or older sky dragon's sight is not

impeded by clouds or fog, or by spells that create areas of fog.

Grounding Breath (Su) Any flying creature damaged by the

breath weapon of an ancient or older sky dragon must

make a Fortitude save with the same DC as the sky dragon's

breath weapon or lose the ability to fly for 1d4 rounds.

Primal Lightning (Su) An old or older sky dragon's breath

weapon can affect creatures normally immune or resistant

to electricity damage. A creature immune to electricity

damage still takes half damage from the breath weapon (no

damage with a successful saving throw). Resistant creatures'

electricity resistance is treated as 10 less than normal.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older sovereign dragon can

assume any humanoid form three times per day as polymorph.

Dogmatic Discordance (Su) Good or evil creatures take a

-2 penalty when making saving throws against a sovereign

dragon's spells, spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura.

Golden Armor (Su) Once per day as a standard action, an old

or older sovereign dragon can cover its form in golden

armor, granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC and energy

resistance 15 to one energy type, chosen at the time the

armor is summoned. This armor lasts for a number of

rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The sovereign

dragon can dismiss the armor as a free action.

Master Counterspelling (Su) A great wyrm sovereign dragon can

counterspell once per round as an immediate action. It need

not know the spell it is countering, but can instead expend any

spell that is one level higher to automatically counter the spell.

Violent Retort (Ex) When a young or older sovereign dragon

takes damage from a melee attack critical hit, it can, as an

immediate action, make a claw or tail slap attack against the

creature that made the critical hit.
