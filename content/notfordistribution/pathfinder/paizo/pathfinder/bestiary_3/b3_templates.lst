#CREATING AN ANIMAL LORD
#"Animal Lord" is an inherited template that can be added to any humanoid of 10 Hit Dice or more, referred to hereafter as the base creature. The animal lord also gains the characteristics of one type of animal (of a size no larger than one step larger than the base creature's size), referred to hereafter as the base animal.
#CR: Same as the base creature or the base animal (whichever is higher) +2.
#Alignment: Any neutral.
#Type: The base creature's type changes to outsider (native, shapechanger). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: An animal lord gains the senses of both the base creature and the base animal in both of its forms.
#AC: An animal lord gains the base animal or base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is higher, in both of its forms-this bonus is increased by +2 to determine the animal lord's actual natural armor bonus.
#Defensive Abilities: An animal lord gains DR 10/silver. It also gains all of the base animal's defensive abilities in both of its forms.
#Speed: An animal lord's base speed is that of its base creature form or its base animal form, whichever is greater. Animal lords whose base animal has a burrow, climb, f ly, or swim speed can use that mode of movement even in humanoid form, instantly growing the necessary appendages as necessary.
#Melee: An animal lord in humanoid form can instantaneously transform parts of its body to make all of the natural attacks possessed by the base animal. An animal lord typically prefers to use its natural attacks in melee combat, but often carries manufactured ranged weapons to diversify its combat options as well.
#Special Attacks: An animal lord gains all of the special attacks possessed by the base animal and can employ them in both humanoid and animal form. It also gains abilities determined by its species affinity (see below).
#Ability Scores: Animal lords use the higher ability score between the base creature and the base animal as their base ability scores, then increase all of these ability scores by +4.
#Skills: An animal lord gains all of the base animal's racial modifiers to skill checks.
#Special Qualities: An animal lord gains the following special qualities.

CREATING A PENANGGALEN

"Penanggalen" is an acquired template that can be added

to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to

hereafter as the base creature). Most penanggalens were

once humanoids or 


	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid


	s and nearly

every penanggalen is female. A penanggalen uses the base

creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as base creature +1.

216

Illustration by Kieran Yanner

Alignment: Any evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented).

Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.

Senses: A penanggalen gains Darkvision 60 ft.

Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6.

Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s.

All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. As

undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma modifier to

determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).

Defensive Abilities: A penanggalen gains channel

resistance +4, 


	DR:5/silver and slashing, resistance to cold

10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive abilities granted by

the undead type. A penanggalen also gains 


	.

Weaknesses: A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In addition, a penanggalen is staggered while outside of her human body and exposed to direct sunlight.

Speed: When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she retains the same base speed as the base creature. When a penanggalen is separated from her body, she has only a f ly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability. 

Melee: A penanggalen gains a Bite attack and a Slam attack when she is detached from her body. Damage is standard for attacks of these types for the penanggalen's size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Special Attacks: A penanggalen retains all of the base creature's special attacks. She also gains the following additional special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the penanggalen's HD + the penanggalen's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.

Blood Drain (Su): A penanggalen's blood drain special attack causes 1d4 Constitution damage.

Create Spawn (Su): When a penanggalen slays a female humanoid via blood drain, and if that slain humanoid had at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal is under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and remains enslaved until that penanggalen's destruction. A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling no more than twice its own Hit Dice any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become freewilled undead.

Disease (Su): Any creature a penanggalen Bites is exposed to filth fever-the save DC against this disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease itself.

Wither (Su): A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul bile that blisters and weakens living f lesh. Any creature that is damaged by a penanggalen's Slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4 Charisma damage.

Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score.



Skills: A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Fly, Knowledge (arcana), Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.

Special Qualities: A penanggalen gains the following special quality.

Separate (Su): During the day, a penanggalen has the same appearance as she did in life, and does not detect as undead (though she is still an undead creature). At night, she can detach her head and entrails as a fullround action. Her physical but now hollow body exists as dead f lesh, but can be destroyed if it suffers damage equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point total. Before a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to her body, at which point any damage done to the body immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is destroyed can never again walk the day in living form, but is otherwise unharmed (save for no longer having a safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a penanggalen wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her f ly speed, or any of her special penanggalen attacks.
