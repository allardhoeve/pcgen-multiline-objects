CREATING AN ANIMAL LORD

"Animal Lord" is an inherited template that can be added to any humanoid of 10 Hit Dice or more, referred to hereafter as the base creature. The animal lord also gains the characteristics of one type of animal (of a size no larger than one step larger than the base creature's size), referred to hereafter as the base animal.

CR: Same as the base creature or the base animal (whichever is higher) +2.

Alignment: Any neutral.

Type: The base creature's type changes to outsider (native, shapechanger). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: An animal lord gains the senses of both the base creature and the base animal in both of its forms.

AC: An animal lord gains the base animal or base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is higher, in both of its forms-this bonus is increased by +2 to determine the animal lord's actual natural armor bonus.

Defensive Abilities: An animal lord gains DR 10/silver. It also gains all of the base animal's defensive abilities in both of its forms.

Speed: An animal lord's base speed is that of its base creature form or its base animal form, whichever is greater. Animal lords whose base animal has a burrow, climb, f ly, or swim speed can use that mode of movement even in humanoid form, instantly growing the necessary appendages as necessary.

Melee: An animal lord in humanoid form can instantaneously transform parts of its body to make all of the natural attacks possessed by the base animal. An animal lord typically prefers to use its natural attacks in melee combat, but often carries manufactured ranged weapons to diversify its combat options as well.

Special Attacks: An animal lord gains all of the special attacks possessed by the base animal and can employ them in both humanoid and animal form. It also gains abilities determined by its species affinity (see below).

Ability Scores: Animal lords use the higher ability score between the base creature and the base animal as their base ability scores, then increase all of these ability scores by +4.

Skills: An animal lord gains all of the base animal's racial modifiers to skill checks.

Special Qualities: An animal lord gains the following special qualities.

Change Shape (Su): An animal lord has two forms-a humanoid and an animal form. When an animal lord in humanoid form uses the base animal's defensive abilities, movement types, attacks, and other features, the animal lord's body instantaneously changes as appropriate to allow the use of that ability, growing wings or claws or fangs as necessary. The animal lord can use this ability to take the shape of the base animal (as shapechange) as a move action.

Dominion (Su): In both forms, an animal lord is treated as if constantly under the effects of a speak with animals spell, but this only applies to creatures of the animal lord's species affinity (see below). In addition, an animal lord can cast charm animal on any animal of its affinity as a spell-like ability at will (CL equals the animal lord's HD).









CREATING A FEY CREATURE

"Fey Creature" is an inherited or acquired template that

Camouf lage (Ex) A fey creature can use Stealth to hide

in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not

grant cover or concealment. It gains a +4 racial bonus on

Stealth checks. This bonus does not stack with any racial

Stealth bonus possessed by the base creature.

Change Shape (Su) A fey creature can change shape into

a single form. Possible forms include a normal specimen

of its base creature, a humanoid creature within one size

category, or an animal within one size category. In all

cases, the fey creature appears as the same individual of

its alternate form each time it changes shape. The type

of polymorph spell used should be chosen as appropriate

based on the alternate form, such as alter self for taking

humanoid form. This ability can be selected more than

once, granting an additional form each time.

Energy Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains resistance 10

to one energy type, or increases an exiSting resistance by

10. Resistance increased beyond 30 becomes immunity

instead. This ability can be selected more than once.

Evasion (Ex) A fey creature gains evasion, as the rogue

ability of the same name.

Long Step (Su) A fey creature can teleport up to 10 feet

per Hit Die as a move action. It may use this ability once

every 1d4 rounds.

Spell Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains SR equal to 11 +

its CR. This does not stack with any exiSting SR possessed

by the base creature.

Trackless Step (Ex) A fey creature does not leave a trail in

natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. It can choose

to leave a trail, if it so desires.

Vanish (Su) As a swift action, a fey creature can vanish for

1 round as if affected by invisibility. It can use this ability for

1 round per day per Hit Die.

Woodland Stride (Ex) A fey

creature can move through

any sort of undergrowth

(such as natural thorns,

briars, overgrown areas, and

similar terrain) at its normal

speed and without taking damage

or suffering any other impairment.

Thorns, briars, and overgrown

areas that have been magically

manipulated to impede

motion still affect it.

Optionally, this ability may

function in a different type

of terrain, to allow the fey

creature to move through,

swamps, rocky areas, ice,

and so forth. Whatever

the choice, this ability

only functions in one

type of terrain. This ability can be selected more than

once, for a different terrain each time.

Spell-Like Abilities: A fey creature with an Intelligence

or Wisdom score of 8 or more has a cumulative number

of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice. Unless

otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster

level equals the creature's HD (or the caster level of the

base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).

HD Abilities

1-2 Dancing lights 3/day, faerie fire

3-4 Entangle, glitterdust

5-6 Deep slumber

7-8 Major image

9-10 Confusion

11-12 Feeblemind

13-14 Mislead

15-16 Project image

17-18 Irresistible dance

19-20 Scintillating pattern

Abilities: A fey creature gains a +4 bonus to Dexterity

and a +2 bonus to Intelligence and Charisma. A fey

creature receives a -2 penalty to Strength. Fey creatures

derived from creatures without an Intelligence score gain

an Intelligence of 3.

Skills: A fey creature with racial Hit Dice has skill

points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence

modifier. It gains Acrobatics, Bluff, Fly, and Stealth

as class skills.

Languages: Fey creatures speak Sylvan as well

as any 
	AUTO:LANG|spoken by the base creature.







CREATING A PENANGGALEN

"Penanggalen" is an acquired template that can be added

to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to

hereafter as the base creature). Most penanggalens were

once humanoids or 


	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid


	s and nearly

every penanggalen is female. A penanggalen uses the base

creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as base creature +1.

Alignment: Any evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented).

Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.

Senses: A penanggalen gains Darkvision 60 ft.

Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6.

Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s.

All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. As

undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma modifier to

determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).

Defensive Abilities: A penanggalen gains channel

resistance +4, 


	DR:5/silver and slashing, resistance to cold

10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive abilities granted by

the undead type. A penanggalen also gains 


	BONUS:VAR|FastHealingRate|5.

Weaknesses: A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In

addition, a penanggalen is staggered while outside of her

human body and exposed to direct sunlight.

Speed: When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she

retains the same base speed as the base creature. When a

penanggalen is separated from her body, she has only a f ly

speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.

Melee

: A penanggalen gains a Bite attack and a Slam

attack when she is detached from her body. Damage is

standard for attacks of these types for the penanggalen's

size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Special Attacks: A penanggalen retains all of the base

creature's special attacks. She also gains the following

additional special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2

the penanggalen's HD + the penanggalen's Charisma

modifier unless otherwise noted.

Blood Drain (Su): A penanggalen's blood drain special

attack causes 1d4 Constitution damage.

Create Spawn (Su): When a penanggalen slays a female

humanoid via blood drain, and if that slain humanoid had

at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as

a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal is

under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and

remains enslaved until that penanggalen's destruction.

A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling

no more than twice its own Hit Dice

any spawn it

creates that would exceed this limit become freewilled

undead.

Disease (Su): Any creature a penanggalen Bites

is exposed to filth fever-the save DC against this

disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease

itself.

Wither (Su): A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul

bile that blisters and weakens living f lesh. Any creature

that is damaged by a penanggalen's Slam attack must

succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4

Charisma damage.

Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an

undead creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score.

Skills: A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff,

Fly, Knowledge (arcana), Perception, Sense Motive, and

Stealth checks.

Special Qualities: A penanggalen gains the following

special quality.

Separate (Su): During the day, a penanggalen has the

same appearance as she did in life, and does not detect

as undead (though she is still an undead creature). At

night, she can detach her head and entrails as a fullround

action. Her physical but now hollow body exists

as dead f lesh, but can be destroyed if it suffers damage

equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point total. Before

a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her

entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to

her body, at which point any damage done to the body

immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen

herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is

destroyed can never again walk the day in living form,

but is otherwise unharmed (save for no longer having a

safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a penanggalen

wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her f ly

speed, or any of her special penanggalen attacks.
