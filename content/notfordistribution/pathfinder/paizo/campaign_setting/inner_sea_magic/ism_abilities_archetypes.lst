	DESC:Although Sarenrae is seen mainly as a goddess of healing and redemption in most parts of the Inner Sea, her stern, evil-smiting element is more common in areas like Qadira, Osirion, and Katapesh. Many of the Dawnflower's disciples from these lands become Dawnflower dervishes, religious mystics who use a spinning dance as part of their worship. Many bards of her faith hone their skills with dance and scimitar to become dervish dancers, but some tread a similar path focused more on magic and healing than swordplay. These are the Dawnflower dervishes.

Battle Dance
	KEY:Battle Dance ~ Dawnflower Dervish
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality
	DESC:A Dawnflower dervish is trained in the use of the Perform skill, especially dance, to create magical effects on himself. This works like bardic performance, except that the Dawnflower dervish's performances grant double their normal bonuses, but these bonuses only affect him. He does not need to be able to see or hear his own performance. Battle dancing is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, and effects that affect bardic performance, except that battle dancing does not benefit from the Lingering Performance feat or any other ability that allows a bardic performance to grant bonuses after it has ended. The benefits of battle dancing apply only when the bard is wearing light or no armor. Like bardic performance, battle dancing cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities. Starting a battle dance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires the Dawnflower dervish to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move action. Like a bard, a Dawnflower dervish's performance ends immediately if he is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round. A Dawnflower dervish cannot perform more than one battle dance at a time. At 10th level, a Dawnflower dervish can start a battle dance as a swift action instead of a move action. When the Dawnflower dervish uses the inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics bardic performance types as battle dances, these performance types only provide benef it to the Dawnflower dervish himself. All other types of bardic performance work normally (affecting the bard and his allies, or the bard's enemies, as appropriate). This ability alters the standard bardic performance ability.

Meditative Whirl
	KEY:Meditative Whirl ~ Dawnflower Dervish
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.BardDirgeOfDoom
	DEFINE:MeditativeWhirlTimes|1
	DESC:When using battle dance, the Dawnflower dervish can enter a trance-like state where his spinning motion represents the movement of the planets around the sun, and his spirit is attuned to the healing aspects of Sarenrae. By spending a move action focusing on his whirling, the dervish can apply the Quicken Spell feat to any cure spell he is about to cast (effectively spending a move action and swift action to cast the spell). This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time.

Familiar Tattoo
	KEY:Familiar Tattoo ~ Tattooed Sorcerer
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SorcererBloodlinePowerLvl1
	DESC:A tattooed sorcerer gains a familiar as an arcane bond, as a wizard equal to her sorcerer level. Her sorcerer levels stack with any wizard or witch levels she possesses when determining the powers of her familiar--this ability does not allow her to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Unlike most familiars, her familiar can transform itself into a tattoo that she carries in her flesh. Transforming into a tattoo or back to normal familiar form is a move action for her familiar. In tattoo form, the familiar looks like a stylized version of itself, but does not count as a creature separate from the tattooed sorcerer. In tattoo form it continues to grant its special familiar ability, but otherwise has no abilities and can take no actions except to transform from tattoo into creature. A familiar tattoo cannot be erased or dispelled. This ability replaces the 1st-level bloodline power.

Create Spell Tattoo
	KEY:Create Spell Tattoo ~ Tattooed Sorcerer

	DEFINE:TattooedSorcererCreateSpellTattooTimes|1
	DESC:At 7th level, a tattooed sorcerer can create a spell tattoo %1 times per day with a single touch as a standard action. The recipient of the spell tattoo must be willing to receive the spell tattoo. If she gives the spell tattoo to herself, it does not count against the regular limit of magic tattoos she can have. The spell tattoo must be of a spell that she knows that has no material or focus component. She can maintain one spell tattoo created by this ability at a time---if she uses this ability again, the previous spell tattoo she created fades away. Spell tattoos she creates with Inscribe Magic Tattoo do not count against this limit. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 7th level.|TattooedSorcererCreateSpellTattooTimes

Enhanced Varisian Tattoo
	KEY:Enhanced Varisian Tattoo ~ Tattooed Sorcerer
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SorcererBloodlinePowerLvl9
	DESC:At 9th level, the tattooed sorcerer can pick any one spell she knows for which she has a Varisian Tattoo feat. This spell must be one that lacks focus components and costly material components. She can now use that spell as a spell-like ability once per day. This spell-like ability is not enhanced by her Varisian Tattoo, but it functions at +2 caster levels above her sorcerer caster level. Whenever she gains a bloodline power at a later date, she may change this spell-like ability to another qualifying spell. This ability replaces the 9th-level bloodline power.
