###Block: Rope Tricks
# Ability Name		Unique Key						Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																														Source Page
Coil
	KEY:Coil ~ Rope Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can coil rope rapidly, requiring only 1 round to coil 20 feet of rope. (Coiling 20 feet of rope normally takes 1d6 rounds.)
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Hogtie
	KEY:Hogtie ~ Rope Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:When you attempt to tie up an opponent you are grappling, your penalty is only 5 instead of the normal 10.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Knotted Weapon
	KEY:Knotted Weapon ~ Rope Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can use a knotted length of rope as a spiked chain that inflicts bludgeoning damage instead of piercing damage.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Last
	KEY:Last ~ Rope Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can use a length of rope as a whip at no penalty. The piece of rope that is used as a whip must be 10 feet longlength in excess of this must remain coiled or otherwise unused at your feet or side.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Lifeline
	KEY:Lifeline ~ Rope Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary
	DESC:When you or a nearby creature is falling (from a failed Climb check or otherwise), you can throw a held rope as an immediate action, maintaining a grip on one end. If you are falling, this is treated as an attempt to catch yourself while falling made with a +10 bonus, but there must be some sort of solid anchor available for your rope to loop around. When attempting this check on another creature, treat it as if you yourself were falling. If the weight of the creature exceeds twice your heavy load limit (your own equipment does not count against this maximum), you are pulled after it.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Quick Release
	KEY:Quick Release ~ Rope Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can secure a rope such that you can loose it from either end by making a quick series of tugs (a move action) at any point along the ropes length.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Slip Away
	KEY:Slip Away ~ Rope Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary
	DESC:You gain a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from ropes and ropelike restraints (such as vines).
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Tangle
	KEY:Tangle ~ Rope Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can throw a coiled length of rope as a ranged weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the target becomes entangled. It can cut or burst the rope, or escape with a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The rope must be unsecured to use this trick.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49



###Block: Sunrod Tricks
# Ability Name		Unique Key						Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																														Source Page
Flare
	KEY:Flare ~ Sunrod Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary
	DESC:As a standard action, you can expend the remaining life of a sunrod (lit or unlit) in an instant. Sighted reatures within a 20-foot-radius burst of the sunrod must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 2d4 rounds. Creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness receive a 2 penalty on their saving throws. Alternatively, as a full-round action, you can strike a creature with the sunrod or throw the sunrod as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface, it f lares as describe above. Since you dont have to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at the corner of particular 5-foot square. Treat the target corner as AC 5. If a creature is struck by the sunrod and fails its Fortitude save, it is blinded for the first round of its dazzled condition.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Fast Sunrod
	KEY:Fast Sunrod ~ Sunrod Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can draw and light an easily accessible sunrod from a pack as a swift action.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Like the Sun
	KEY:Like the Sun ~ Sunrod Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can use a sunrod as an additional material component for any spell that bears the light descriptor. The spell is treated as one spell level higher (to a maximum of 9th level) for all purposes, including the calculation of saving throw DCs and its ability to overcome sources of magical darkness.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Lodge Sunrod
	KEY:Lodge Sunrod ~ Sunrod Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary
	DESC:You can throw your sunrod as a ranged improvised weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the sunrod does no damage, but stays lodged on the target until the target or another creature spends a move action to remove it.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Lure
	KEY:Lure ~ Sunrod Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary
	DESC:As a move action while holding a lit sunrod in your hand, you can attempt to move an animal in any direction you desire. Make a Handle Animal check against a DC of 15 + the target animals CR. If you are successful, the animal moves 5 feet in the desired direction on its next turn. For every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, the animal moves another 5 feet, up to the animals maximum speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, though if one is taken, the animal immediately stops moving (whether or not the attack hits). You cannot move an animal into an obvious hazard with this trick, but you can (for example) lure it into an open cage.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.49

Twice as Brightly
	KEY:Twice as Brightly ~ Sunrod Trick
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary
	DESC:As full-round action, you can tamper with an unused sunrod such that it burns out in a single hour, but shines much more brightly. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by two steps for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes normal light, and dim light or normal light becomes bright light). It does not increase the light level in bright light.
