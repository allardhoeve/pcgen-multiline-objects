Call Fire
	KEY:Call of Fire ~ Arson Subdomain
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower DESC:As a standard action, you can stretch out your hand toward any visible fire source within 60 feet and beckon it toward you. This causes a ribbon-thin streak of fire to approach you in a straight line through the air. Any creature directly in the fire ribbon's path takes 1d4 points of fire damage; a successful Reflex save (DC %1) negates this damage. When the ribbon of fire reaches your hand, it either extinguishes or lights a flammable object of your choice that you're holding. You can use this ability %2 times per day.|DomainFireDC|DomainFireTimes

CATEGORY:Special Ability
	

TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower
	

DESC:At 8th level, you can transmute your body and equipment to ice for a period of time. It takes a standard action to take on the form of ice, and you can end the transmutation with a free action on your turn. When you take on the form of ice, you are immune to cold and have DR 5/-, but you take twice the normal amount of damage from fire. You can take on the form of ice %1 rounds per day. The rounds need not be consecutive.|DomainLVL

KEY:Sift ~ Flotsam Subdomain

CATEGORY:Special Ability

TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower

DESC:Once per day you can reach into

a maximum gp value of %1. The water you reach into must

be at least deep enough to fully immerse yourself.|PREVAR

At 12th

level, objects you retrieve are not broken. At 20th level you

can retrieve objects worth up to 5,000 gp. If retrieving an

object which would not normally float, assume it rests on

top of, or is entwined with, debris that does float. Objects

retrieved in this manner disappear after 24 hours if they

haven’t yet been used up or otherwise destroyed.

Command
	KEY:Command ~ Inevitable Subdomain
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower

Master’s Yoke (Su): At 8th level you can attempt to

assert your dominance over any visible creature within

30 feet by declaring the target your property. The target

can resist this effect with a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your

cleric level + your Wisdom modifier). If the target fails the

save, it is affected as if by dominate monster for a number of

rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level, save that the target

can choose to ignore any order you give and instead take 2

points of Constitution damage and become staggered for

1 round. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level,

and an additional time per day for every four levels beyond

8th. This is a language-based mind-affecting effect.

Replacement Domain Spells: 1st—charm person, 5th—

dominate person, 8th—binding.





Deadly Weather
	KEY:Deadly Weather ~ Catastrophe Subdomain
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower
	DESC:At 8th level, you can unleash a furious call to the heavens, summoning forth an everchanging storm of destruction %1 rounds per day. This storm has a radius of %2 feet. Each round, the storm has one of the following effects: driving rain (-4 on all Perception checks and ranged attack rolls), howling winds (-8 on Fly skill checks and ranged attack rolls), heavy snow (all terrain is considered difficult), or lightning bolt (as call lightning). Other effects depending on the weather might also apply (at the GM's discretion). You choose which effect takes place each round, but no effect may be repeated on the following round. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.|DomainLVL|DomainLVL*5

Painful Smite (Su): Prior to making a melee attack roll,

you can choose to convert all damage from that strike into

nonlethal damage, adding your Wisdom modifier to the

damage. If you succeed in your attack, you can make an

Intimidate check against your target to demoralize them

as a free action. You gain a bonus on your Intimidate check

equal to the nonlethal damage dealt by the painful strike.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to

3 + your Wisdom modifier.

Replacement Domain Spells: 2nd—pain strike*, 5th—

symbol of pain, 8th—demand.
