Call Fire
	KEY:Call of Fire ~ Arson Subdomain
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.DomainPower DESC:As a standard action, you can stretch out your hand toward any visible fire source within 60 feet and beckon it toward you. This causes a ribbon-thin streak of fire to approach you in a straight line through the air. Any creature directly in the fire ribbon's path takes 1d4 points of fire damage; a successful Reflex save (DC %1) negates this damage. When the ribbon of fire reaches your hand, it either extinguishes or lights a flammable object of your choice that you're holding. You can use this ability %2 times per day.|DomainFireDC|DomainFireTimes

CATEGORY=Special Ability|Sift ~ Flotsam Subdomain
	DESC:Once per day you can reach into water as a standard action and pull out an object with a maximum gp value of %1. This object always has the broken condition upon being withdrawn from the water. The water you reach into must be at least deep enough to fully immerse yourself. If retrieving an object which would not normally float, assume it rests on top of, or is entwined with, debris that does float. Objects retrieved in this manner disappear after 24 hours if they haven't yet been used up or otherwise destroyed.|SiftObjectValue|PREPCLEVEL:MAX=12

	BONUS:VAR|MastersYokeTimes|1+(DomainLawLVL-4)/4
	DESC:You can attempt to assert your dominance over any visible creature within 30 feet by declaring the target your property. The target can resist this effect with a Will save (DC %1). If the target fails the save, it is affected as if by dominate monster for %2 rounds, save that the target can choose to ignore any order you give and instead take 2 points of Constitution damage and become staggered for 1 round. You can use this ability %3 time(s) per day. This is a language-based mind-affecting effect.|DomainLawDC|DomainLawLVL|MastersYokeTimes

Painful Smite
	KEY:Painful Smite ~ Torture Subdomain
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.DomainPower
	DESC:Prior to making a melee attack roll, you can choose to convert all damage from that strike into nonlethal damage, adding your Wisdom modifier to the damage. If you succeed in your attack, you can make an Intimidate check against your target to demoralize them as a free action. You gain a bonus on your Intimidate check equal to the nonlethal damage dealt by the painful strike. You can use this ability $1 times per day.|DomainLawTimes
