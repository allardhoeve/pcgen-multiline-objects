Sly Draw
	TYPE:General
	PREFEAT:1,Quick Draw
	DESC:You can draw your weapon with such speed and finesse that your opponents don't realize they’re threatened.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
	BENEFIT:When you draw a light weapon, you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of a Bluff check to feint in combat. Other feats and abilities that affect a feint still apply to your feint.

Splash Weapon Mastery
	TYPE:General
	DESC:When throwing a splash weapon, you act as if you had the Far Shot feat. When you hit with a splash weapon, select one additional square adjacent to the splash area; creatures in this area also take splash damage. When you miss with a splash weapon, you may adjust the miss direction on the grid by +1 or -1. This feat counts as Far Shot for the purpose of qualifying for other feats, but only in regard to splash weapons.

# I would think this is how to code it, but it doesn't work.  Then again, I don't think Far Shot works as coded either.
