DESC:Unwilling to bend a knee to the devil-worshipers of Cheliax, the people of Andoran declared themselves a free country where all men and women had the right to choose their own rulers. Unique among the lands of Golarion, Andoran is a representative democracy; foreign nobles declare it a doomed experiment, yet simultaneously fear that the power of its philosophy may cause peasant uprisings in their own lands. True Andorens believe in self-determination at all costs, and hate slavery with a passion, even going so far as to send their glorious Eagle Knights on dangerous missions to undermine the slave trade in other lands and spread far and wide the call of freedom.
