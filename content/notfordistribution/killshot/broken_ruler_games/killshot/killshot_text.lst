Design Goals:





Dynamic Pools







Training Points are the Gold Standard -



We need a method to DEDUCT from the Pools and if auto granted NOT deduct.



Soltution 1-



COST:0 on the Abilities for starters - this means that no pool is really deducted from.

BONUS:VAR used in granting and removing pool points.





RANGE in OS cannot be hard coded to give 30 or whatever. We need a fixed range. Should be feasible.



Weapon must be coupled with Melee or Ranged. This is hardcoded.





Do We actually need 'RACE'? It seems to be Human centric, so I don't see a need to belabor race. Not on the Killshot Character Sheet Either.
