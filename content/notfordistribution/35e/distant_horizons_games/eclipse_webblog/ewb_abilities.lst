Shadow Mastery Package
	COST:22
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput
	DESC:Shadow Mastery Package (22 CP Total) -  can tap into the magics of twilight and darkness, channeling those hidden forces into a modest variety of tricks. This particular ability package is being purchases as Witchcraft, with all abilities Corrupted / will not work in areas of bright illumination and can be dispelled by light-based powers. &nl; That's a bit of a bottleneck - but this is only a supplementary set of abilities. More importantly, Witchcraft is a very cheap and efficient way to get some fairly good powers - but it doesn't improve much (if at all) with level. Thus it's great for low-level characters, fair for mid-level characters, and only a minor supplement for high-level characters.

#Martial Arts Description Abilities
Nightmare Storm Martial Art
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	SORTKEY:A1
	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput
	DESC:This martial art focuses on channeling negative energy into the user's hands and weapons, allowing him or her to cleave through armor to hit more accurately, absorb the energy of incoming blows with his or her bare skin, sense the life energy of foes, cause them to crumple when struck, and to disrupt their bodies with a mere touch. It is, however, a terrible strain on the metabolism of a living creature
	DESC:Basic Abilities; Attack 4, Defenses 3, Strike, Synergy/Channeling Checks. Advanced and Master Techniques; Blind-Fight, Mighty Blow, Reach, and Weapon Kata (Pick). Occult Techniques; Inner Strength x2, Paralyze, and Touch Strike.

Obsidian Heart Kung Fu
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	SORTKEY:A1
	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput
	DESC:Obsidian Heart Kung Fu is a purely mystical form which progresses from simple evasion and awareness of the user's surroundings (basic Defenses and Mind Like Moon) on to generating a seething aura of negative energy around the user - an amorphous, quasi-solid thing which lashes out to strike at opponents or deflect incoming attacks while the user remains virtually immobile. At it's highest levels, the user may even support or move his or her own body with the aura, allowing him or her to accomplish some fairly impressive feats - although this comes at a considerable cost to his or her energy reserves. Basics; Attack 4, Defenses 4, Power 2, Strike, Synergy/Hide, Synergy/Move Silently. Advanced and Master Techniques; Reach, Mind Like Moon (may avoid being surprised or caught flat-footed with a DC 15 reflex save), Breaking (may add martial arts skill to the strength check when trying to break objects), Expertise (May transfer up to five points from attack bonus to armor class as a dodge bonus if making an attack). Occult Techniques; Inner Strength, Ki Block, Light Foot, and Vanishing.

Sardorian Archery Style
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	SORTKEY:A1
	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput
	DESC:The Sardorian Style focuses on military discipline. Ignore distractions, remain calm, draw smoothly, focus on your target, release, and repeat. Trust your allies to keep the enemy troops off you and use volley fire to deal with major opponents.  Unfortunately, since arrows have distinct limitations as weapons (at least for more-or-less normal people in a d20 universe), be prepared to fall back and switch to a different weapon.  Basics; Attack 4, Power 2, Synergy/Craft (Bowyer), Synergy/Hide, and Toughness 2. Advanced and Master Techniques; Deflect Arrows, Rapid Shot, Mighty Blow, and +1d6 Sneak Attack. Occult Techniques; Inner Strength, Ki Focus, Serpent Strike, and Touch Strike.

# Rithian Blade Master ~ Package Deal
Rithian Blademaster Package Deal
	COST:0
	KEY:Rithian Blade Master
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.PackageDeals
	DESC:The Rithian Blademasters are one of the oldest and most respected warrior-orders of the western realm. While they have several rival schools, the purity of the Rithian techniques is unquestioned and the honor of their school has been fiercely maintained across the centuries. More than a few great champions have come from their halls. They will NOT be pleased to hear that an undead horror is using, and abusing, their techniques, and will certainly sponsor efforts to eliminate such a dishonor.
	ABILITY:Character Points|AUTOMATIC|Rithian Blade Master ~ Package Deal
	COST:0
	



Block/Melee (4 CP) with Multiple (4 CP) and Riposte (4 CP), all Corrupted/only usable while using a sword.
	KEY:Rithian Blade Master ~ Package Deal
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput
	DESC:A Rithian-trained fighter can attempt (by spending an Attack of Opportunity and making a DC 20 Reflex Save) to block up to sixty points of damage from a successful melee attack up to twice per round - and if they do successfully block an attack (and have another Attack of Opportunity available to use), they get an immediate counterstrike at their full BAB. Given Borez's horrific Reflex save, he can generally pretty well count on deflecting two melee attacks - and getting two extra attacks of his own - every round that he's in melee as long as his opponents can hit him at all.





# Knight of Hades Template	
Greater Undead Package
	COST:64
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput
	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE.GreaterUndeadPackage
	BENEFIT:All of these effects are Specialized - the user becomes an undead horror, seeks to prey on the living, becomes vulnerable to being Turned (Channeling), and will find it essentially impossible to turn away from evil without dying. This does mean that a couple of the defenses are double-specialized, but - in this case - the effects don't overlap, and so I'll give permission for that.

	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.GreaterUndeadPackage

Knight of Hades Basic Upgrades

	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Basic Upgrades
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE.KnightHadesTemplateUpgrade
	BENEFIT:Knights of Hades add the following items to the basic Greater Undead Package, leaving them subject to the same limitations. This does require that the limitations be upgraded a bit though; the Knights of Hades are major champions of the Dark Powers - and so their activities draw a constant



+4 Charisma
	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ CHA 4

	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Privilege

	DESC:(3 CP).



Infernal Command Package
	COST:58
	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Infernal Command
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.KnightHadesTemplate
	DESC:Newly-recruited Knights of Hades are generally powerful warriors, but usually lack the ability to cast, or effectively counter, spells. To counter this weakness, they are granted the direct command over magical energies. That doesn't give them any particularly sophisticated effects to call on, but it certainly gives them a variety of options.

Metamagic/Easy and Metamagic/Elemental Manipulation with the Fast modifier and four levels of Streamline
	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Metamagic
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.KnightHadesTemplateInfernal
	DESC:all Specialized and Corrupted/Only works to Quicken his spells and to change the damage of damage-causing spells to Profane/Negative Energy damage, requires the patronage of the greater powers of the lower planes, who WILL demand regular services and offerings, must possess - and prominently display - a very expensive (2500 GP+) bejeweled unholy symbol to gain this enhancement (14 CP).

	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Mastery x2 all Theurgy Verb Skills

	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.KnightHadesTemplateInfernal
	DESC:Specialized and Corrupted/only for Theurgy, only allows a single spell to be cast despite the Quickening effect (6 CP).



# That gives our Knights of Hades a total template cost of 160 CP - in +4 ECL territory. If you're converting a character into a Knight of Hades in Eclipse, simply add that to his or her racial package, eliminate any overlapping or conflicting elements (such as a Constitution bonus or Penalty), and see what you wind up with.


#   If you start with a normal human though, you'll still wind up with a +4 ECL modifier.






###Block: Sample Relics


# Torc of the Deceiver
Shapeshift, with Shape of Death
	KEY:Torc of the Deceiver ~ Shapeshift
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.TorcOfTheDeceiver
	DESC:Specialized and Corrupted/only allows shifting into a normal human and is essentially cosmetic. The user seems quite normal and can eat, drink, and enjoy the other pleasures of life - but his or her actual game statistics are unchanged. Unfortunately, any major use of dark powers (such as his Infernal Command abilities) will burn away the quasi-illusory shell like tissue paper (4 CP).

Advanced Shape of Death/the user may become Incorporeal
	KEY:Torc of the Deceiver ~ Advanced Shape of Death
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.TorcOfTheDeceiver

+2d6 (10) Mana with the Spell Enhancement option
	KEY:Obsidian Athame ~ Mana
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.TorcOfTheDeceiver
	DESC:(4 CP). Note that a sacrifice will only restore two points of this reserve - but Anek can call upon it to unleash a few really impressive spells if he must.



# The Shard of Dust
Channeling/Conversion to a Level Five Effect
	KEY:The Shard of Dust ~ Channeling
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.ShardOfDust
	DESC:(9 CP). The spell is Dust of Ages - a version of Animate Dead that requires neither gems nor bodies. Unfortunately, the lack of a solid structure means that the creatures called forth are unstable, and will return to the dust from which they were summoned after 1d4+1 hours.

Immunity/the distinction between weapons and himself
	KEY:ABT ~ Immunity
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.ABT
	DESC:(Common, Minor, Major, Specialized in Swords, 3 CP). For true blademasters, their weapons are truly extensions of themselves; attempts to sunder or disarm them are simply treated as normal attacks against hem, and any touch-based powers and "unarmed" combat enhancements or martial arts which they may possess operate through their blades.

Reflex Training/Combat Reflexes Variant
	KEY:ABT ~ Reflex
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.ABT

Immunity/Penalties for wearing armor
	KEY:ABT ~ Immunity Armor
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:Extra.EclipseAbilityOutput.ABT

	BENEFIT:Powerful enchanted objects are rare and expensive, while few men possess the potential to wield the greater magics - but a great many people can learn a few techniques for channeling ambient magical energy into enhancing their abilities.
	





Immunity to Dispelling, Antimagic, and Countermagic
	KEY:Immunity ~ AnekBorez
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.TheLesserMastery
	DESC:(Common/Minor/Great). Specialized in protecting innate enchantments only, Corrupted/only covers powers in this package (4 CP)



# A great many campaigns will limit characters to 11,000 GP worth of Innate Enchantments - enough to grant characters some interesting and useful powers, and to make them considerably more likely to survive at lower levels, but not enough to make any really major changes at high levels. This batch of abilities would normally cost 880 XP to activate - but we don't really need to worry about that in an NPC.


Blessings of the Darkness
	COST:24
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.AnekBorez
	BENEFIT:Long decades of service and honor as a mortal had earned Borez several blessings - some modest portion of the powers of a true Paladin. Of course - as often happens when a mortal finds such a path too difficult to follow and turns to darkness - the powers of the lower planes were more than happy to replace those lost blessings.





Improved Augmented Bonus / CHA for Reflex Save
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.AnekBorez
	BENEFIT:May add his (Cha Mod) to his Reflex Saving Throws, Specialized/only works as long as he continues to enjoy the favor of the dark powers (6 CP).

	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Abilities.AnekBorez
	COST:12
	BENEFIT:A lucky character may either "Take 20" in advance, without taking extra time and whether or not this would usually be allowed, or reroll after the primary roll once per day. Most characters also get Bonus Uses.



The Lure of the Night
	COST:12
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.AnekBorez
	DESC:This isn't a tremendous amount of power - although the ability to simply create his weapons and armor on the spot is pretty handy - but it is a good deal more than most villagers ever get, it's fairly versatile, and it can be used without destroying his disguise. It's also something that he can offer to teach new recruits. Besides, the small illusions - and the ability to deceive divination effects - both come in very handy in masking his true nature.

###Block: The Ancient One


The Ancient One (+2 ECL)
	KEY:Ancient One ~ The Ancient One
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Template_Ancient_One.Template_Ancient_Onex
	SORTKEY:Ancient_One_a
	DESC:The basic "Ancient One" has "lived" two to four "prior lives", and - most often - "started out" as a beast or as a talisman-making shaman or some such. Since this is pretty obviously an acquired template to be stacked over an existing race, it's been built with a total of 64 CP - making it a +2 ECL template over whatever it's applied to.

Prior "Lives"
	KEY:Ancient One ~ Prior Lives
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Template_Ancient_One.Template_Ancient_Onex
	SORTKEY:Ancient_One_b
	DESC:+3 Specialities in each of three times and places where the character "previously lived". These can usually be applied to rolls related to events during the period, cultural questions, and general knowledge of the period. Note that a single speciality could cover several lifetimes in a boring area, a nonsentient lifetime won't require one at all, and an exciting life full of travel might require two or even all three. (3 CP).

The Memory of Stone
	KEY:Ancient One ~ The Memory of Stone
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Template_Ancient_One.Template_Ancient_Onex
	SORTKEY:Ancient_One_c
	DESC:Immunity/Forgetting Things and Memory Alteration (Uncommon, Minor, Great, 6 CP); Ancient Ones are immune to effects that produce forgetfulness or alter memories of level seven or below, and get a +8 bonus both on attempts to recall specific things they've observed and on saving throws versus higher-level effects that produce forgetfulness or alter memories.

Bearer of Lost Lore
	KEY:Ancient One ~ Bearer of Lost Lore
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Template_Ancient_One.Template_Ancient_Onex
	SORTKEY:Ancient_One_d
	DESC:Occult Skill/Secrets (3 CP). Each skill point invested in the "Secrets" skill brings extraordinary knowledge - the names of a dozen powerful fey, the routes through the crypts beneath the sacred mountains, how to open the seven gates of the netherworld, or the summoning chant of the three winds. The game master may let a character roll against his or her Secrets skill to see if they know some bit of lost information - or simply give the user additional secrets/plot hooks when it's convenient.

Rune Weaver
	KEY:Ancient One ~ Rune Weaver
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Template_Ancient_One.Template_Ancient_Onex
	SORTKEY:Ancient_One_e
	DESC:All Ancient Ones - for some unknown reason - have a strong affinity for Rune Magic, gaining the Magician (6 CP) and Runic Ritual (6 CP) abilities. They also gain Adept x2, although the second instance is Specialized/two skills only (9 CP). Each Ancient One may select three Rune Casting and three Rune Mastery skills which he or she may buy for half price. These are his or her core magical abilities.

Past Master
	KEY:Ancient One ~ Past Master
	CATEGORY:Special Ability
	TYPE:EclipseAbilityOutput.Template_Ancient_One
	SORTKEY:Ancient_One_f
	DESC:+8 to their primary spellcasting attribute for magical purposes (in general, for learning and casting spells and for bonuses to magical skills), Corrupted/does not increase save DC, Specialized/only affects bonus slots and skill scores for Rune Magic, not for other spellcasting and magic-related skills (8 CP). For unknown reasons, all Ancient Ones are attuned to the magic of runes - and even without any great fund of personal power have developed the skill to cast at least a few spells.

Who were you in your earlier lives, how did those memories wind up in a talisman, and what were those lives like? Playing an Ancient One involves coming up with a fair amount of information), Hunted (the Ancient Ones always have enemies), and Insane (Ancient Ones act pretty oddly, tend to upset people, never forget an injury or offence, and are often so weird that they're believed possessed) (-10 CP).
