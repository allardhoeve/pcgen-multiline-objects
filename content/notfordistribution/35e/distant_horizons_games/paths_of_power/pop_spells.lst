Earthward

	SCHOOL:Evocation
	DESCRIPTOR:Neutral
	CLASSES:ALL=3
	COMPS:V, F
	CASTTIME:Special
	RANGE:Personal
	TARGETAREA:You
	DURATION:Instantaneous
	DESC:Earthward diverts a portion of the effects of an incoming attack into the surrounding environment. It can be invoked as a free action during any creatures turn just after the damage, and any other effects, of an attack have been determined. When invoked it will negate either up to 3d8+(min(CASTERLEVEL,15)) [+1/Level, 15 Max] points of damage or any one special effect resulting from that attack, such as poison, energy drain, or paralysis. The effect relies on an innate attunement to the energies of the natural world however, hence it cannot be used in devices, or by non-neutral or undead casters.

Earthward, Grand
	KEY:Earthward (Grand)

	TARGETAREA:One creature per level, no two of which may be more then 30 feet apart.
	DURATION:Special (D)
	SAVEINFO:Will Negates (Harmless)
	SPELLRES:No (Harmless)
	DESC:Grand Earthward diverts a portion of the effects of incoming attacks into the local environment. It can be invoked as a free action during any creatures turn just after the damage, and any other effects, of an attack have been determined. When invoked it will negate a total of up to 10 points of damage per level (250 maximum) and special attack effects (Paralysis, Poison, Energy Drain, Etc) - although each such effect negated counts as 25 points of damage from any attacks affecting each target within the next three rounds. The effect relies on an innate attunement to the energies of the natural world however, hence it cannot be used in devices or by non-neutral or undead casters. The effect is individual: if one character takes 260 points of damage from dragon breath, but his friend saves and takes 130, the first will take 10 points of damage, the second still has 120 points of protection remaining - presuming that the spell was cast at an effective level of 25.

	CASTTIME:1 standard action
	RANGE:Personal

	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)
	DESC:This spell functions as per Resist Energy, except that it only functions against electricity and defends against 20 points of damage instead of 10.

Manufacture
	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
	SCHOOL:Transmutation
	CLASSES:ALL=8
	COMPS:V, S, M
	CASTTIME:See text
	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:Up to 20 cu. ft./level; see text
	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:None
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:Favored by the most highly-skilled Gnomish crafters, Manufacture allows for more efficient and powerful crafting than Fabricate. You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by this spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the skill of the caster - and the caster is considered to have "taken 10" with respect to the skill roll to make any such item. If used on minerals, halve the maximum target amount. Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be affected by the spell. Material Component: The raw materials required to craft the item to be created.

Mine Seed
	KEY:Mine Seed ~ PoP
	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
	SCHOOL:Transmutation
	CLASSES:ALL=9
	COMPS:V, S
	CASTTIME:1 hour
	RANGE:Touch
	TARGETAREA:One rock
	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:No
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:One of the finest dwarven spells, Mine Seed allows a powerful spellcaster to open new mines for the future by planting a special mine seed. While this has no immediate effects, the Mine Seed will slowly grow and develop, until, in a few centuries, a fine new mine with rich veins of excellent ores, gemstones, and nicely arched caverns will finally mature. Although most other races don't know it, this spell has kept humans and elves in comfort for quite a while - on many worlds, the natural and easily available stocks of metals were exhausted millennia ago, or would have been if the dwarves didn't keep planting more mines. Classically gems and precious metals generally didn't simply disappear in massive quantities. Spellcasters, however, quite routinely use up large amounts of precious metals and gems as components, disintegrate things, and spend vast amounts of money on item creation. While what happens to that money is never clearly specified, there's no option for saving it by gathering your own ingredients, no mention of evil spellcasters extorting assistance instead of paying for it, or of it entering the local economy. Evidently it just vanishes - and at 50 GP to the pound, a high level character's equipment may account for the disappearance of tons of gold or a hundred tons of copper and silver. It all must come from somewhere.

Protection from Extremes
	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
	SCHOOL:Abjuration
	DESCRIPTOR:Neutral
	CLASSES:ALL=1
	DESCRIPTOR:Good
	TYPE:Arcane.Divine
	COMPS:V, S, M/DF
	CASTTIME:1 standard action
	RANGE:Touch
	ITEM:Potion
	TARGETAREA:Creature touched
	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes [D]
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES:No; see text
	DESC:This spell functions like Protection from Evil, except that the +2 deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks from extreme-aligned creatures (either CE, CG, LE, and LG or CN, NG, LN, and NE depending on what the game master opts to consider "extreme") creatures, and extreme-aligned summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.

Rational Discussion
	KEY:Rational Discussion ~ PoP
	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
	SCHOOL:Abjuration
	CLASSES:ALL=4
	COMPS:V, S
	CASTTIME:1 standard action
	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:20 ft radius burst
	DURATION:10 minutes per level
	SAVEINFO:None
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:This spell banishes the forces of alignment from the area, freeing everyone there from such effects. While the spell lasts, everyone and everything is considered True Neutral, and is free to act as such. When the spell ends, or characters leave the affected area, they are again affected by their alignments. As a forced change, this does not affect their actions or abilities thereafter. It should be noted that in the d20 system alignments are absolute forces - detectable, measurable, and controllable things governed by the energies of the outer planes. While characters are normally free to choose which outer plane, if any, they are attuned to, this spell simply blocks off that energy flow. Like a spell that removes the air from the area, it can be countered, dispelled, or evaded by leaving the area, but it cannot be saved against or resisted. It isn't affecting the character.

Return to Nature
	SOURCEPAGE:p.35
	SCHOOL:Transmutation
	CLASSES:ALL=2
	COMPS:V, S
	CASTTIME:1 standard action
	RANGE:Touch
	TARGETAREA:One corpse or [caster level] cubic feat of organic material
	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:No
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:This handy spell eliminates ordinary organic material, including irritating dead bodies. The material falls to ash, dust, or dirt instantly. Many casters use it to destroy old stumps, get rid of algae over favored fish ponds, or speed up composting. Less scrupulous casters use it to eliminate rivals' trade goods, valued spices, and the like. Adventurers may find it helpful to simply eliminate rivals, as the spell renders a corpse unusable for most resurrection magic.

Spark Storm
	SOURCEPAGE:p.35
	SCHOOL:Evocation
	DESCRIPTOR:Electricity
	CLASSES:ALL=4
	COMPS:V, S, M
	CASTTIME:1 standard action
	RANGE:0 ft
	TARGETAREA:25 ft radius aura.
	DURATION:1 round per level (D)
	SAVEINFO:None
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:Spark Storm surrounds the caster with an aura of static electricity. While this will not affect anyone the user is touching and wishes to exclude, everything else who comes within 25 feet of the user or whom the user comes within 25 feet of while the spell is in operation will take 2d6 points of electrical damage once per round.

Stormblade
	SOURCEPAGE:p.35
	SCHOOL:Evocation
	DESCRIPTOR:Electricity
	CLASSES:ALL=3
	COMPS:V, S
	CASTTIME:1 standard action
	RANGE:0 ft.
	TARGETAREA:Energy weapon or aura around a weapon
	DURATION:1 minute per level (D)
	SAVEINFO:None
	SPELLRES:Special.
	DESC:Stormblade creates a weapon of any type you are proficient with made of crackling electrical energy or imbues a metal weapon electrical energy. A weapon so imbued does an extra 3d6 electrical damage which is not affected by spell resistance. A weapon of pure energy does 3d6 + Level (15 Maximum) damage as a touch attack, but is affected by spell resistance and does not gain the benefits of your Strength bonus. The spell does not function underwater.

Thunderbolt
	SOURCEPAGE:p.35
	SCHOOL:Evocation
	DESCRIPTOR:Electricity
	CLASSES:ALL=2
	COMPS:V, S, M
	CASTTIME:1 standard action
	RANGE:Medium
	TARGETAREA:One creature
	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:Special
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:You release a bolt of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (Max 10d6) to the target creature or object. There are two major variants on this spell: one is a beam attack which requires a roll to hit as a ranged touch attack but offers no save, the other automatically hits but allows a Fortitude save for half damage. Material Component: A twig from an oak tree. It'd be easier to simply change the elemental descriptor on "Scorching Ray", but our researcher wanted a spell with a longer range.

Thunderclap
	SOURCEPAGE:p.35
	SCHOOL:Evocation
	DESCRIPTOR:Sonic
	CLASSES:ALL=1
	COMPS:S
	CASTTIME:1 standard action

	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:Fortitude Negates
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:Thunderclap generates [1+Level/4, 3 maximum] deafening bangs. While each must be within range, they may be targeted individually. Each creature in a spread will be deafened for an hour

	SCHOOL:Abjuration
	DESCRIPTOR:Neutral
	CLASSES:ALL=8
	COMPS:V, S
	CASTTIME:1 standard action
	RANGE:20 ft.
	TARGETAREA:One creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you
	DURATION:1 round/level (D)
	SAVEINFO:See text
	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)
	DESC:A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by extreme-aligned creatures, and causing extreme-aligned creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has three effects. First, each warded creature gains a +2 resistance bonus on saves. This benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by extreme-aligned creatures. Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against good, evil, lawful, and chaotic spells and spells cast by extreme-aligned creatures. Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as Protection from Evil does.

Word of Balance
	KEY:Word of Balance ~ PoP
	SOURCEPAGE:p.36

	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:None or Will negates; see text
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:Any extreme-aligned creature within the area of a Word of Balance spell suffers the following ill effects. Equal to caster level Deafened; Up to caster level -1 Slowed, deafened; Up to caster level -5 Paralyzed, slowed, deafened; Up to caster level -10 Killed, paralyzed, slowed, and deafened. The effects are cumulative and concurrent. No saving throw is allowed against these effects.
