##
Healing Shift

When a therianthrope shifts forms, it heals a

limited amount of damage.

Prerequisites: Therianthrope.

Benefit: When a therianthrope changes forms,

it immediately heals a number of hit points equal

to its total character level (Hit Dice plus any class

levels). This does not function if the therianthrope

is slain (and reverts back to its animal form). This

feat is usable once per day.

Normal: Therianthropes do not regain lost hit

points for changing forms.



Quicken Shift

A therianthrope can change forms slightly faster

than normal.

Prerequisites: Therianthrope, Int 13+.

Benefit: When a therianthrope changes forms it

does so as a move action.

Normal: Changing forms is a standard action.

(snakes only) as an evil cleric rebukes or commands
