Combat
	SOURCEPAGE:p.6
	DESC:Foes can attack an abyssal harvester's tentacles. A tentacle has AC 21 (+11 natural), touch 10, flat-footed 21, and can withstand 30 points of damage. Damaging or severing a tentacle does not harm the abyssal harvester (damage dealt to a tentacle is not subtracted from its hit points).

Natural Weapon
	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
	DESC:An abyssal harvester's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Debilitating Constriction
	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
	DESC: (Su): An abyssal harvester that has successfully grappled an opponent of its size or smaller deals tentacle damage plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. A creature reduced to Constitution 0 by an abyssal harvester dies. Note, that the abyssal harvester only deals Constitution damage when constricting a foe.

Far Reaching
	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
	DESC: (Su): An abyssal harvester can remain on its abyssal plane and inject up to four of its tentacles across the dimensions and into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, material planes, or Nine Hells. It can do this a total of twelve times per day (so it could inject one tentacle twelve times into any plane, or four tentacles up to three times each). All of its tentacles must be injected into the same plane, and all appear within the same 20-foot area. While using this ability, it uses sensory organs on its tentacles to see, hear, smell, and feel its surroundings. It can attack normally (at its full attack bonus) while using this ability but it cannot move from its current location. It can withdraw its tentacles as a move action and reinject them into the same plane (or a different plane) on its next turn. A dismissal, dispel chaos, or dispel evil spell (using the second effect of either spell) causes an abyssal harvester to withdraw a single tentacle (whichever one was touched) if it fails its Will save. It cannot re-inject that same tentacle into the same plane for one day. A banishment spell forces an abyssal harvester to withdraw all of its tentacles if it fails its Will save. It cannot re-inject any tentacles that were banished into the same plane for one day.

Harvest
	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
	DESC: (Su): This ability can only be used when the abyssal harvester is on its abyssal plane and injects its tentacles into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, a material plane, or the Nine Hells. A grappled foe with 20 or fewer hit points or 4 or fewer Constitution points must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be drawn through an invisible planar gate (created around the abyssal harvester's tentacles) onto the same plane where the abyssal harvester currently resides. The save DC is Charisma-based. An opponent drawn into the same plane with the harvester is still grappled upon arrival.

Improved Grab
	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
	DESC: (Ex): To use this ability, an abyssal harvester must hit an opponent up with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals automatic tentacle damage and Constitution damage (see debilitating constriction) each round the hold is maintained.

Plane Shift
	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
	DESC: (Sp): An abyssal harvester can enter the Astral Plane, the Abyss, the Nine Hells, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the abyssal harvester and up to six other creatures in its grasp. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level 18th).

Tentacle Regeneration
	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
	DESC: (Ex): An abyssal harvester regrows any lost tentacles in 1 week.
