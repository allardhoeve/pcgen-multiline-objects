#Aberrant 7


Oversized Weapon (Ex): An aberrant wields a Huge greatclub without penalty.





#Abyssal Wolf 8
Paralyzing Gaze (Su): Anyone within 40 feet meeting the gaze of an abyssal wolf must make a successful Will save (DC 16) or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. Half-fiends and tieflings have a -2 penalty on their save. Once a successful save is made, the target is immune to the effects of that abyssal wolf's gaze attack for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Trip (Ex): An abyssal wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+9 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the abyssal wolf.

Favored Prey (Ex): An abyssal wolf has a +2 bonus on Listen, Sense Motive, and Spot checks against non-evil half fiends and tieflings.

Keen Scent (Ex): An abyssal wolf can detect prey within 60 feet by sense of smell. This range increases to 120 feet if the opponents are upwind; and decreases to 30 feet if downwind. By making a successful Wisdom check (DC 15) the abyssal wolf can determine whether a tiefling or half-fiend is present among the opponents.

Know Alignment (Su): Abyssal wolves always know the alignment of any creature they look upon. This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the abyssal wolf can activate it again as a free action on its next turn.

Skills: An abyssal wolf has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent. This bonus rises to +6 when tracking non-evil half fiends or tieflings by scent.







#Ahlinni (Cackle Bird) 9
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every three rounds as a standard action, an ahlinni can expel a pinkish gas in a 20-foot cone. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC Fortitude save or fall prone, laughing manically as if affected by a Tashaa's hideous laughter spell (caster level 4th). The effects last 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution- based.

Impale (Ex): When an ahlinni charges a foe, it deals 2d8+4 points of damage on a successful strike with its bite attack.

Birdsong (Su): An ahlinni can freely communicate with any bird or bird-like creature (such as rocs, giant eagles, and giant owls), perfectly mimicking any bird song or vocalization. Communication with non-intelligent bird creatures is on an empathic level, and can only take place if the bird is within 100 feet. In this case, this ability functions as a speak with animals spell (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated. The ahlinni can restart it as a free action on its next turn.

Fast Healing (Ex): An ahlinni heals 2 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.

Skills: *An ahlinni has a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in treetops. An ahlinni has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks, and can take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.



#Angel, Empyreal 10
An empyreal's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Radiant Blast (Su): Once per day, an empyreal can increase the radiance of its form and release it in a cone-shaped blast to a range of 60 feet that deals 15d6 points of damage and blinds any creature in the area (as the blindness spell) for 3d6 minutes. Affected creatures can attempt a DC 21 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid being blinded. The save DC is Constitution- based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-aid, continual flame, detect evil, discern lies (DC 19), dispel magic, holy smite (DC 18), invisibility (self only), remove curse (DC 17), remove disease (DC 17), remove fear (DC 15); 2/day-blade barrier (DC 20), cure moderate wounds (DC 16), flame strike (DC 19), scorching ray (3 rays); 1/day-heal, raise dead. Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Spells: Empyreals can cast spells as 13th-level clerics. An empyreal has access to any two of the following domains: Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based. Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (6/6/ 6/5/4/3/2/1; save DC 13 + spell level): 0-create water, guidance, light, purify food and drink, read magic, resistance; 1st-bless (x2), bless water, command, divine favor (x2); 2nd- align weapon, bull's strength, consecrate, hold person(x2), silence; 3rd- cure serious wounds,daylight, invisibility purge, searing light (x2); 4th-dimensional anchor, divine power, inflict critical wounds, summon monster IV; 5th-greater command, mark of justice, plane shift; 6th-harm, planar ally; 7th-summon monster VII. Domain Spells (Good, War): 1st-protection from evil; 2nd- spiritual weapon; 3rd-magic vestment; 4th-holy smite; 5th-dispel evil; 6th-blade barrier; 7th-holy word.



Aura of Goodness (Su): An empyreal radiates an aura in a 30-foot radius spread around its form. Any non-evil creature in this area attempting to attack the empyreal must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be overcome with awe and unable to take any action, other than a move action that round. Evil creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be unable to even look at that empyreal for one day. An affected evil creature functions as if blinded (as the blindness spell) when attacking that empyreal. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the aura of goodness of that empyreal for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

#Arcanoplasm 11
Acid (Ex): An arcanoplasm secretes a highly corrosive acid that dissolves only flesh. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Constrict (Ex): An arcanoplasm deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an arcanoplasm must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Arcane Spell Mimicry (Ex): An arcanoplasm can mimic any arcane spell of 4th level or lower that is cast within 30 feet of it. The spell takes effect on the arcanoplasm's next action, has a caster level of 7th, and does not require any components. The save against a mimicked spell has a DC of 12 + the level of the spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Absorb Arcane Magic (Ex): Any arcane spell cast at an arcanoplasm is automatically absorbed. This cures 1 point of damage per 3 points of damage the spell would otherwise deal (non-damaging spells cure 1 point of damage per spell level of the spell). Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but neither do they affect an arcanoplasm. An arcanoplasm cannot absorb divine magic and is affected by it normally.

Amorphous (Ex): Arcanoplasms have no discernable front or back and are not subject to critical hits. They cannot be flanked.

Arcanesense (Su): An arcanoplasm can automatically detect the location of any arcane spellcaster within 100 feet. This functions as a detect evil spell but there is no chance the arcanoplasm is stunned and it is not blocked by stone, lead, or other material.



#12
Blindsight (Ex): An arcanoplasm's entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.

Immunities (Ex): Arcanoplasms are immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.

Skills: An arcanoplasm has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.



#Asrai 12
Spells: An asrai casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer. The save DC against a spell cast by an asrai is 12 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Typical Sorcerer Spells Prepared (Cast per Day 6/7/ 5; save DC 12 + spell level): 0-dancing lights, daze (x2), detect magic, flare, resistance, touch of fatigue; 1st-hypnotism, obscuring mist, reduce person, sleep; 2nd-Tashaa's hideous laughter, touch of idiocy. Spell-Like Abilities: 2/day-control water, fog cloud, obscuring mist. Caster level 5th.

Cold (Su): The touch of an asrai is supernaturally cold. All damage dealt from an asrai's natural attacks is cold damage. This ability is constant, but the asrai can suppress or resume it at will as a free action.

Water Dependent (Su): An asrai that moves more than 50 feet from her water source, can survive on land for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the suffocation rules in the DMG). Lost Constitution points are immediately restored if she is returned to the water. If her Constitution reaches 0, she dies, her form collapsing into a puddle of water.

Skills: An asrai has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. Asrai use their Dexterity modifier (instead of Strength modifier) on Swim checks.



#Barbegazi (Ice Gnome) 14
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day-chill metal (DC 12), icicle blast (as burning hands, but shards of ice that deal cold damage) (DC 11). Caster level 3rd. The save DCs are Charisma-based and include a +2 racial bonus.

Snow Move (Ex): Because of its oversized flat feet, a barbegazi can walk on top of deep snow and suffers no penalties when moving through snowy terrain.

Skills: Barbegazis receive a +2 racial bonus to Craft (trapmaking), Hide and Survival checks. *The Hide bonus increases to +6 in their natural environment.



#Bedlam 14
Chaos Burst (Su): Once per round as a standard action, a bedlam can release a burst of crackling gray energy in a 20-foot radius around itself. Lawful creatures caught in the area take 5d8 points of damage and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. Non-lawful and non- chaotic creatures take 3d8 points of damage, but are not staggered. A DC 18 Will save halves the damage. Chaotic-aligned creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution based.

Chaotic Resonance (Su): A bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos; an invisible and ever-changing ring of chaotic matter. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within 20 feet of the b e d l a m . Spellcasters in the area must make a s u c c e s s f u l caster level check (DC 18) each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item used within this area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round. A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. The check DC and save DC is Constitution based. Spells with the "chaotic" descriptor that are cast within this area function as if they were empowered (as by the Empower Spell feat). Chaotically-aligned weapons (anarchic weapons) deal an extra 1d6 points of damage while in this area (i.e., an anarchic weapon deals an extra 3d6 points of chaotic damage against lawful- aligned foes). Lawful-aligned weapons are unaffected by this aura.

Detect Law (Su): A bedlam can continuously detect law as the spell (caster level 10th), though there is no chance of it becoming stunned by overwhelming lawful auras. It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

Immunity to Chaos (Ex): The bedlam cannot be affected by any spell, spell-like ability, weapon, magic item, or supernatural effect that has the chaotic or anarchic descriptor. Creatures with the chaotic subtype are unaffected by this immunity and can attack the bedlam normally.

Immunity to Transformation (Ex): No mortal magic can affect or fix a bedlam's ever-shifting chaotic form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into its new shape for a moment, but it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free action at the start of its next turn.

Resistance to Law Spells (Ex): The bedlam has SR 20 against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects with the "law" descriptor. This spell resistance also applies to spells of the Law domain.

Skills: *A bedlam's grayish coloration grants it a +8 racial bonus to Hide checks when in areas of thick fog or smoke.



# Giant Beetle Shared
Tremorsense (Ex): Giant beetles can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.



#Beetle, Giant Blister 16
Blister Spray (Ex): Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, a blister beetle can shoot a jet of inky black liquid in a 20-foot line. A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid the spray. On a failed save, the target takes 1d3 points of acid damage and a -2 conditional modifier on attack rolls and ability and skill checks for the next 1 minute (10 rounds) from painful blisters and welts that quickly appear on exposed skin. A DC 10 Heal check or any cure spell heals the blisters and negates the penalties. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Skills: *Blister beetles have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in their natural surroundings.

#Beetle, Giant Saw-tooth 17
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a giant saw- toothed beetle must hit an opponent up to one size larger with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold.

#Beetle, Giant Water 17
Ink Cloud (Ex): A giant water beetle can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the giant water beetle normally uses to escape. All vision within the cloud is obscured.

Water Dependent (Ex): Giant water beetles can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, refer to the suffocation rules in the DMG.

Watersense (Ex): Giant water beetles can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with water.

Skills: *Underwater, a giant water beetle has a +4 bonus on Hide and Spot checks. A giant water beetle has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.



#Bloodsuckle 18
Blood Drain (Ex): A bloodsuckle that grapples a foe can drain blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. Once it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it releases the victim so it can continue to rely on it as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have transformed into hosts (see below) unless they are extremely hungry.

Create Host (Ex): A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a special sap into the victim that disrupts the synapses in the victim's brain and transforms it into a host if it fails a DC 18 Will save. This acts as a dominate monster spell (caster level 8th) with no duration. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. A victim that fails its Will save becomes a host for the bloodsuckle, and returns to the plant whenever it calls. A host is normally only used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack, it may summon its hosts to defend it. A host with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed another Will save (same DC) with a +4 bonus to break the effects of the bloodsuckle's control.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bloodsuckle must hit a creature of any size with a tendril attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can drain blood.

Seed (Ex): Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a host's body. The host wanders off, and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open, growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. At Constitution 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A remove disease spell destroys the seedling as do spells such as limited wish, wish, or miracle.

# 19
Summon Host (Ex): A bloodsuckle can generate a high- pitched whine that only its hosts can hear. A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant. So long as the bloodsuckle and its host are on the same plane of existence, the host hears and answers the call. Usually, a bloodsuckle only calls its hosts when it becomes hungry for blood-about once every three days.

Blindsight (Ex): A bloodsuckle has no visual organs but can ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.

Host Sense (Ex): A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any of its hosts to a range of 100 feet.



#Bog Creeper 19
Constrict (Ex): A bog creeper that makes a successful grapple

check against an opponent of its size or smaller using a tendril

attack deals 1d4+4 points of damage each round the hold is

maintained.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bog creeper must hit

with a tendril attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the

grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Spit Acid (Ex): Three times per day, a bog creeper can spray a

cone of digestive acid to a range of 30 feet that deals 2d8 points of

acid damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex save DC 20 for

half). It cannot use this ability if it is currently holding a creature

in its mouth. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Camouflage (Ex): When at rest, a bog creeper appears as a

normal plant. It takes a successful DC 20 Spot check to notice it

before it attacks. Anyone with Survival or Knowledge (nature)

can use those skills instead of Spot to notice the plant.

Marsh Move (Ex): A bog creeper can move across marshy

terrain without incurring any movement penalties.

Marshsense (Ex): Bog creepers can automatically detect the

location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the same

marshy ground it is.

Skills: A bog creeper has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check

to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always

choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or

endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided

it swims in a straight line.



#Brass Man 20
Spit Molten Brass (Su): Once every 1d4

rounds (and no more than five times per

day), a brass man can spit a stream of

molten brass in a 30-foot line; damage

6d6 fire, Reflex DC 15 half.

The save DC is Constitution-based.



Immunity to Magic (Ex): A brass man is immune to any

spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In

addition, certain spells and effects function differently

against the creature, as noted below.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a

brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving

throw.

A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow

effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each

3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the

amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full

normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit

points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.



#Burning Dervish 21
Flame Form (Su): Three times per day, as a standard

action, a burning dervish can change its form to

that of a column of fire. In this form it gains two slam

attacks and deals 1d6 points of fire damage each time

it hits or grapples an opponent. Additionally, a foe

must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire.

Creatures hitting a burning dervish in flame form

with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire

damage as though hit by the burning dervish's attack,

and also catch on fire unless they make a successful

Reflex save.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day-invisibility (self only),

pyrotechnics (DC 14); 2/day-enlarge person (DC 13)

or reduce person (DC 13) (either can be used on the

burning dervish), produce flame. Caster level 14th.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Elemental Endurance (Ex): Burning dervishes can

survive on the Elemental Planes of Air or Earth for

up to 48 hours and on the Elemental Plane of Water

for up to 12 hours. Failure to return to the Elemental

Plane of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies after that

time deals 1 point of damage per hour to a

burning dervish until it dies or returns

to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

Plane Shift (Sp): A

burning dervish can

enter any of the elemental

planes, the

Astral Plane, or

the Material

Plane. This

ability transports

the

burning dervish

and up to eight other

creatures, provided they all

link hands with the burning

dervish. I t i s

otherwise similar to the

spell of the same name

(caster level 13th).



#Cadaver 22
Disease (Ex): Filth fever-claw or bite, Fortitude

save DC 11, incubation period 1d3 days; damage 1d3

Dexterity and 1d3 Constitution (see Disease in the

DMG). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Reanimation (Ex): When reduced to 0 hit points or

less, a cadaver is not destroyed; rather it begins the

process of reanimating by regaining 1 hit point per

round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are

not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit

point total (minus damage dealt from magical attacks

and weapons), it stands up, ready to fight again.

If the creature is destroyed by a cleric's turning

ability, it cannot reanimate. If a cleric casts gentle

repose on the cadaver when it reaches 0 hit points, it

cannot reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation,

causing the creature to regain hit points at half

its normal rate (i.e., 1 hit point every other round).



#Caterprism 23
Crystal Silk (Ex): Three times per day, as a standard

action, a caterprism can spew forth a crystalline

silk-like substance in a 20-foot cone. The substance

instantly solidifies to a rock-like hardness, forming

needle-sharp spears of crystal that impale those in the

area and deal 3d6 points of piercing damage. A DC 17

Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Crystalline Mandibles (Ex): The mandibles of a

caterprism are so powerful that they can bite through

nearly anything. The bite attack of a caterprism is

treated like a touch attack; i.e., it ignores any armor

bonus.

Further, the bite of a caterprism is considered to have the

vorpal special quality, and on a successful critical hit with its

bite attack, the caterprism severs the head of its opponent.



#Cave Leech 24
Blood Drain (Su): A cave leech can suck blood from a

foe with its bite by making a successful grapple check. If it

pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution

drain each round the pin is maintained.

Constrict (Ex): A cave leech deals 1d4+2 points of

damage with a successful grapple check. If an opponent is

being grappled when a tentacle is severed, the tentacle

continues to constrict and deals one-half damage (1d2+1).

(See tentacles, below.)

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cave leech

must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. A cave leech

gains a +4 bonus to its attack roll if it bites a grappled foe.

Tentacles (Ex): A single tentacle is AC 13 and has 5 hit

points. Damaging a tentacle does not harm the cave leech

itself. Severing a tentacle does not break its hold on a

creature it is grappling, but does reduce the damage by one

half (see constrict, above). A severed tentacle has a grapple

check of +2, and a severed tentacle regrows in 1d4 days.

Tremorsense (Ex): A cave leech can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in

contact with the ground.

Skills: Cave leeches have a +8 racial bonus on Hide

checks.

A cave leech has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always

choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or

endangered. It can use the run action while swimming,

provided it swims in a straight line.



#Cerebral Stalker 25
Consume Brain (Ex): Once it has its victim underground, the

cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly

chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4 points of damage

each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker has

reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours.

A victim slain in this manner is ejected from ground and becomes

a zombie (see below).

Create Zombie (Su): A creature whose brain is devoured by a

cerebral stalker is ejected from the ground and animates as a

zombie in 1d4 rounds. Zombies created in this manner are not

under the control of the cerebral stalker.

Fear Gaze (Su): The eyes of a cerebral stalker instill fear in

living creatures that meet its gaze. Creatures must succeed on a DC

16 Will save or stand shaking in fear and unable to act for 1d4

rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting

fear effect. On a successful save, that creature is immune to the fear

gaze of that cerebral stalker for one day.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cerebral stalker must

hit with both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can

use its web ability to cocoon its foe.

Web (Ex): Once per round, and no

more than three times per day, a

cerebral stalker can cocoon a

grappled foe by shooting sticky

webbing from its body. The

webs cover as much of the

victim as possible, excluding

the top of the

victim's head, its eyes,

and its nose. The

webs remain attached

to the

cerebral stalker's

body and stretch

from just under its

arms to its knees.

A webbed victim

is anchored to

the cerebral

stalker and cannot

move.





The webbed creature can, as a standard action, break free with a

successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check.

The webbing has 8 hit points and a DR of 5/fire. Note the victim

is still grappled even if it breaks the webbing and must succeed at

a grapple check to get completely free of the cerebral stalker's

grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength

check includes a +4 racial bonus.

# 26
Earth Glide (Ex): A cerebral stalker can glide through

stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as

easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves

behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or

other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area

containing a burrowing cerebral stalker flings the cerebral

stalker back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless

it succeeds on a Fortitude save (DC 15).

Sink (Su): After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker

begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim

with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to

completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the

creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist;

in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both

stalker and foe are completely underground. Creatures

attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the

sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above),

and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral

stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking

cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold person spell) for a

number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker

fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each

round to negate the paralysis.

The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the

victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis).

The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk

radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as

locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory

magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom

spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk

immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects

both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the

surface.

Tremorsense (Ex): A cerebral stalker can automatically sense the location of any creature in contact with the ground to a range of 90 feet.

#Church Grim 27
Howl (Su): The howl of a church grim causes any evil

creature within its churchyard to succeed on a DC 14 Will

save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Good or neutral

creatures are unaffected as long as they are not there to steal

from the dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save

is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same church

grim's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Wisdom Damage (Su): The incorporeal bite of a church

grim deals 1d6 points of holy damage and 1d4 points of

Wisdom damage to a target. A successful DC 14 Fortitude

save negates the Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-

based. On each successful attack, the church grim

gains 5 temporary hit points.

Know Alignment (Su): A church grim makes automatically

knows the alignment of any creature that enters its churchyard.

This ability is always active and cannot be negated.



Limited Domain (Ex): The realm of a church grim

encompasses only the churchyard; it can wander freely in its

cemetery, the churchyard, and within the church itself. It

cannot move beyond the precincts of the churchyard; it

must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.

Rejuvenation (Su): A church grim reduced to 0 or less

hit points restores itself in 24 hours, completely healed, if it

makes a successful level check (1d20 + the church grim's

HD) against DC 16. The only sure way to get rid of a church

grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the

churchyard.

Soul Defender (Su): It is the sacred duty of a church grim

to defend the bodies and souls of those buried in its churchyard.

Any attempt to cast an animate dead or similar spell

within the confines of the church grim's domain requires

the caster to succeed on a DC 20 caster level check.

Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the

full wrath of the church grim immediately.



#Cinder Ghoul 28
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a

cinder ghoul's slam attack gain one negative level.

The DC is 18 for the Fortitude save to remove a

negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

For each such negative level bestowed, a cinder

ghoul gains 5 temporary hit points.

Fire (Su): Any opponent struck by a cinder

ghoul's slam attack must succeed on a DC 18

Reflex save or catch fire (see catching on fire in

the DMG). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Smoke Inhalation (Su): As a full round action,

a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its

smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent by

moving into a space occupied by an opponent.

The target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude

save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside

the victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues

and organs, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage

each round for 1d4+2 rounds. The affected

creature can attempt another Fortitude save each

round to cough out the burning residue. A successful

save halts the damage. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Smoke Form (Ex): A cinder ghoul's natural

form is similar to the gaseous form spell, though

the creature retains its natural armor bonus, all

attacks, and can use its supernatural abilities. Its

fly speed is 40 feet per round with perfect maneuverability.

A cinder ghoul is subject to the effects

of wind (in that it can be blown away, but it

cannot be dispersed and takes no damage from

wind). A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other

liquid and cannot pass through small holes or

narrow openings.



#Clamor 29
Sonic Burst (Ex): When angered, a clamor can emit a

massive onslaught of sonic energy as a full-round action

that can be heard for miles in all directions. Any living

creature within 100 feet of the clamor must succeed on a DC

15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Further,

living creatures within 50 feet of the clamor must succeed

on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be permanently deafened. A

restoration, wish, miracle, or remove blindness/deafness spell

restores hearing and negates the stunning effect. The save

DCs are Constitution-based.

Natural Invisibility (Su): As creatures of living sound,

a clamor is naturally invisible, even when it attacks. This

ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge

spell.

Perfect Mimic (Ex): A clamor can duplicate any

sound it has ever encountered with near perfect accuracy

as a free action. Being accustomed to tone and

pitch, a bard may make a DC 20 Bardic Knowledge

check to determine that the sounds

are being produced artificially.

Another Bardic

Knowledge check (same

DC) allows the bard to realize

that the creature

making the sounds is indeed

a clamor. If the bard

has encountered a

clamor before, the

second check is not

required.

Speed of Sound (Ex): Once per day, a clamor can move

at the speed of sound for a number of minutes equal to its Hit

Dice. Its speed becomes 6,820 feet per round (1,364 squares),

but it cannot attack or make use of any of its other abilities

when moving this way.

Vulnerabilities (Ex): Any spell that creates a zone of

silence or vacuum deals 3d6 points of damage to a clamor

and forces it to make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal

to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability score

modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the

following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways.

Ghost sound, major image, minor image, message, ventriloquism,

whispering wind: These magically generated or altered

sounds force a clamor to make a Will save (DC 10 + spell

level + the caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or act

as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of rounds

equal to the caster's level.

Sculpt sound: Using this spell to warp the sound from

which the clamor is made, the caster deals 1d4 points of

damage per caster level. The clamor is allowed a Fortitude

save (DC 13 + the bard's Charisma modifier) for half

damage.

This spell also enables a bard (and only a bard) to

completely control the actions of a clamor if the

clamor fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level

+ the bard's Charisma modifier). If the clamor fails

the save, it is affected as if by a dominate monster

spell with a caster level equal to that of the

bard's class level.

Shout, sound burst: These spells do no

damage to a clamor, but force it to make a

Will save (DC 10 + spell level + the

caster's appropriate ability score

modifier) or be affected as if by a

charm monster spell with a caster

level equal to that of the

caster.



#Colossus, Jade 30
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4

rounds, as a standard action, a jade colossus can

spray a blast of green energy in either a 60-foot

cone or a 120-foot line. A creature in the

affected area takes 15d6 points of damage (Reflex

save DC 26 for half). A creature slain as the result of this

breath weapon transforms into jade. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

A creature turned to jade has Hardness 6, hp 40. This

effect can be reversed by casting stone to flesh, wish, or

miracle. This restores the creature's body to flesh; afterwards,

it may be raised or resurrected normally. A jade

creature that suffers 40 or more points of damage, or is subjected

to a shatter or disintegrate spell is immediately destroyed. A

destroyed creature can be restored only through the successful

casting of a miracle or wish spell.

Light Reflection (Ex): The angles that make up a jade

colossus's form allow it to reflect any light-based attacks or effects

(it cannot reflect natural sunlight however). Reflected light acts

as an emanation (lasting 1 round) that blinds all creatures (as the

blindness spell) within 40 feet for 2d4 rounds. Affected creatures

that succeed on a DC 26 Reflex save are not blinded. Undead and

similar creatures to whom sunlight is harmful to take 6d6 points

of damage (a successful DC 26 Reflex save halves the damage).

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A

jade colossus is immune to any

spell or spell-like ability that

allows spell resistance. In addition,

certain spells and

effects function differently

against the

creature, as noted

below.

A disintegrate spell slows a jade colossus (as the slow spell) for 1d6

rounds, with no saving throw.

A shatter spell deals 3d12 points of damage to a jade colossus,

with no saving throw.

A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect

on the jade colossus and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points

of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of

healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points,

it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A jade colossus receives

no saving throw against fire effects.







#Corpse Rook 32
Rend (Ex): A corpse rook that hits with two or more bite attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d8+7 points of damage.

All-Around Vision (Ex): The three heads of a corpse rook grant it a +4 bonus to Search and Spot checks and prevent it from being flanked.



#Corpsespinner 33
Create Corpsespun (Su): Creatures slain (and not devoured)

by a corpsespinner rise in 1 hour as creatures known

as corpsespuns (see the Corpsespun template in this book).

Poison (Ex): The bite of a corpsespinner delivers a highly

toxic poison. The save DC is Constitution-based and

includes a +2 bonus from the corpsespinner's Ability Focus

feat.

Corpsespinner Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 22 negates,

initial and secondary 2d6 points of Intelligence damage. A

victim whose Intelligence drops to 0 dies in 1 hour unless

the poison is neutralized (such as with a neutralize poison

spell). Slain creatures rise as corpsespun (see its Create

Corpsespun ability above).

Web (Ex): A corpsespinner can fire sticky strands of web

constructed of astral material to a maximum range of 80 feet

(range increment 20 feet) up to 10 times per day. This

webbing is effective against targets up to one size smaller

than the corpsespinner and is similar to a net attack. The

web anchors the target in place allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC

24 Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 28 Strength

check. Both are standard actions. The check DCs are

Constitution-based and include a +4 bonus because the

webs are constructed of astral material. The Strength check

DC also includes a +4 racial bonus.

A corpsespinner can also create sheets of webbing that

cover a 40-foot area. Approaching creatures must make a

successful DC 20 Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they

stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful

web attack. Attempts to escape gain a +5 bonus if the

trapped victim has something to walk on or grab while

pulling free. Each 5-foot section of web has 16 hit points

and damage reduction 5/-.

Astral Jaunt (Ex): A corpsespinner can shift from the

Astral Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift

back again as a move action (or during a move action). This

ability is otherwise identical with the astral projection spell,

except it only transports the corpsespinner.

Astralsense (Su): A corpsespinner can automatically

detect the location of anything within 200 feet of it on the

Astral Plane.

Skills: A corpsespinner can always take 10 on a Climb

check, even if rushed or threatened.



#Crag Man 34
Pierce (Ex): As a free action, a crag man can transform

its hands into stony points. When striking with its

hands in this manner, it deals 1d6+3 points of piercing

damage (rather than bludgeoning damage) with its slam

attack).

Piercer Hellstorm (Sp): Once per day, a crag man

can summon 2d10 piercers (see the revised entry for

piercers in the sidebar) with a 50% chance of success.

Passwall (Sp): Once per day, as a standard action, a

crag man can create an effect similar to the passwall spell

(caster level 3rd).

Stalagmite Form (Ex): A crag man's natural form is

that of a stalagmite. While in this form it does not

radiate magic and true seeing does not reveal its humanoid

form. The crag man can change forms as a free action

once per round.

Tremorsense (Ex): A crag man can automatically

detect the location of anything within 100 feet in

contact with the ground.

Skills: *Crag men receive

a +8 racial bonus to Hide

checks against a background

of stone.



#Crucifixion Spirit 35
Crucify Soul (Su): Once per round, a crucifixion spirit

can point at a single target within 60 feet and crucify its soul.

The crucifixion spirit must succeed on a ranged touch attack. If

successful, the target's soul leaves its body which collapses in a heap

on the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of

the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed,

crucified in midair to a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul

held in place by translucent spikes or nails, driven through the

soul's wrists and feet.

The victim is not dead and is visible to all those viewing it.

Furthermore, a crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by

anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see

below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative

levels to it in the round it is crucified, and one negative level each

round thereafter.

A creature slain in this manner cannot be returned to life

except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection

spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the

check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.

A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability

for it to continue to affect a target. It can direct attacks against a

different opponent.

A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by

succeeding on a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul

is freed and returns to its body in the same round. The target is

stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally.

The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

A crucifixion spirit can use this ability five times per day.

Paralysis (Su): A living creature hit by a crucifixion spirit's

incorporeal touch must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be

paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Remove paralysis or any other spell that

can remove a curse removes the paralysis. The effect cannot be

dispelled. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Immunity to Turning (Ex): A crucifixion

spirit cannot be

turned, rebuked,

or commanded.



#Demon, Caizel 36
Caizel's natural weapons,

as well as any weapons

she wields, are treated as

chaotic-aligned and

evil-aligned for the purpose

of overcoming

damage reduction.

Poison (Ex):

Caizel's body courses

with a virulent poison

that she can

intensify or suppress 



#37
at will. It is not secreted through her skin (therefore her touch is

not poisonous); rather it is delivered through the exchange of body

fluids with another creature (kissing, consummating an encounter,

etc.). If a target is not willing to be kissed, she must start a

grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. Other methods

of delivery (such as consummation of an encounter) are not

detailed here.

Caizel's poison normally deals 1d8 points of Constitution

damage if the target fails a DC 25 Fortitude save. One minute later

another Fortitude save must be made to avoid another 1d8 points

of Constitution damage.

Caizel can vary the intensity of her poison at will. This

allows her to deliver 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8 points of

Constitution damage (as both initial and secondary damage).

Alternately, she can suppress her poison completely,

thus dealing no ability damage whatsoever.

darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect law, detect thoughts,

doom (DC 19), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects

only), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), read

summon 1d6 succubi or 1d2 hezrous. Alternately, she can

attempt to summon 1d4 chaaors (see their entry in this book) with

a 70% chance of success.

Touch of Ecstasy (Su): Once per round, by making a

melee touch attack against a foe, Caizel can flood the

creature's mind with the most pleasurable images it can

conjure if it fails a DC 25 Will save. This effect stuns the

creature for 1d4 rounds while its mind processes the information.

A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected

by Caizel's touch of ecstasy for one day. The save DC is

Constitution-based. Caizel can suppress this ability at will.

Skills: Caizel has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Bonerazor: Bonerazor is a finely crafted and perfectly

balanced +2 dagger. Because of its expert craftsmanship it

deals 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit. Additionally,

a creature hit must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or be held

(as by a hold person spell). The creature can make a new save

each round to escape. A creature remains held as long as

Bonerazor remains embedded in its body or until it makes a

successful Fortitude save. So long as Caizel is within 50 feet

of it, she can command the dagger to return to her hand as

a free action.



#Demon, Chaaor 37
A chaaor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons

it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-

aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage

reduction.

#38
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a chaaor

must hit an opponent up to one size larger than itself

with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a hold and can rend.

Rend (Ex): A chaaor that hits with both claw

attacks tears the flesh of its opponent. This

attack automatically deals 2d8+12 points of

damage.

Roar (Ex): Three times per day, a

chaaor can loose a powerful and

deadly roar that deals 3d6 points

of sonic damage to all creatures

within 60 feet that hear it. A

successful DC 17 Reflex

save halves the

damage.

In addition, creatures up to one size

smaller than the chaaor must succeed on a DC 17

Reflex save or be knocked prone from the force of its

roar. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-

darkness, greater teleport (self plus 50

pounds of objects only), see invisibility;

1/day-chaos hammer (DC 16). Caster level 11th.

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Acid and Fire Spittle (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a

greruor can spit a stream of acid in a 30-foot line that deals

4d4 points of acid damage. On the greruor's next turn, the

acid ignites and the opponent bursts into flames, taking

1d6 points of fire damage per round until extinguished

(see the rules for Catching Fire in the DMG). A

successful DC 21 Reflex save halves the acid damage

and prevents the creature from catching fire. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a greruor

must hit with its tongue attack. It



#40
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it establishes a hold and bites.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-confusion (DC 18), deeper

as the spell (caster level 10th).

and Spot checks. Due to the oily and slimy secretions from its

skin, a greruor has a +8 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks.



#Demon, Mallor 40
A mallor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons

it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-

aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage

reduction.

Fear Gaze (Su): The infernal eyes of a mallor

weaken the resolve of opponents peering into them.

same mallor's fear gaze. The save DC is Charisma-

based.

Foul Liquid (Su): All liquids (not just water) within 100

feet of a mallor automatically foul and become unsuitable

for consumption or inhabitation (no save). Creatures drinking

fouled water must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or

become nauseated for 1 minute. Aquatic creatures (or those

that can breathe water) swimming in fouled water must

make a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check)

each round they remain in the area or begin suffocating (see

Suffocation in the DMG).

Magical liquids in the area can make a DC 27

Fortitude save to avoid fouling.

A mallor can foul up to 20 gallons of liquid a day using

this ability. Sentient- or liquid-based creatures (such as

water elementals) must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save



#41
or take 1d8 points of Constitution damage each hour they

remain in the area. At Constitution 0, the creature's liquid

structure fouls and it dies. The save DCs are Constitution-

based. A mallor can suppress or resume this ability at will.

it rips an opponent's flesh with its claws. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

he wields, are treated as evil-aligned and

lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage

reduction.

Fear (Su): By speaking, Caasimolar induces fear in all

creatures within 30 feet that hear him. Creatures within the

- Once per day, it can unleash a line of lightning to a

range of 100 feet. This deals 15d6 points of electricity

damage. A DC 25 Reflex save halves the damage.

- Three times per day, it can produce an effect identical

to a slay living spell. This requires Caasimolar to make

a melee touch attack with the rod. If successful, the

target must make a successful DC 25 Fortitude save or

based.

Summon Devils (Sp): Three times per day,

Demoriel can automatically summon 1d6

erinyes or 1d2 barbed devils or she can

attempt to summon one horned with a

60% chance of success.

takes normal damage from good-

aligned silvered weapons, and

from spells or effects with the

good descriptor.

Resistant to Good Magic (Su):

Demoriel gains a +2 bonus on all saves

against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects

used against her by good-aligned creatures.

Skills: Because of her ability to lie without emotion,

Demoriel gains a +8 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy,

and Gather Information checks.

Reaver: Reaver is a finely crafted +3 unholy short

sword.



#Devil, Flayer 51
A flayer devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Flensing (Ex): A flayer devil that scores a critical hit with

a claw attack rips the flesh from its opponent's body. This

attack deals 1d3 points of Constitution drain.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-detect good, greater teleport

(self plus 50 pounds of objects), scorching ray (3 rays); 1/day-

wall of fire, unholy aura (DC 20). Caster level 12th. The save

DCs are Charisma-based.

Summon Devils (Sp): Once per day, a flayer devil can

attempt to summon 1d4 bearded devils or barbed devils or

another flayer devil with a 35% chance of success.

Unholy Burst (Su): Three times per day, a flayer devil can

release a burst of hellish black vapor in a 30-foot radius. Those

caught within the area must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save

or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. Additionally, good-aligned

creatures suffer 3d6 points of unholy damage from the vapors

if they fail their save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Regeneration (Ex): A flayer devil takes normal damage

from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects

with the good descriptor.



#Devil, Hellstoker 52
A hellstoker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Bellows (Ex): A hellstoker can use its burning hands to light its

bellows as a standard action. This allows the hellstoker to fire a

jet of flame from its bellows in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per

round as a standard action. It must make a successful ranged touch

attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by the fire takes 1d8 points of

fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch

on fire (see Catching on Fire in the DMG).

Fiery Body (Ex): The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly

flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into

flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, but does deal 1d6

points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the

hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds (1 minute) before

extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide;

therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks

(see oily hide below) and it can be caught on fire again.

Hellstokers sometimes light themselves or each other on

fire when combating foes.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-magic circle against

good (DC 13), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds

of objects only); 1/day-burning hands (DC

11 half). Caster level 10th. The save

DCs are Charisma-based.

A hellstoker can use its burning

hands ability to ignite itself or another

of its kind.

Summon Devils (Sp): Once per

day, a hellstoker can attempt to summon

2d8 lemures with a 50% chance

of success, or another hellstoker with

a 35% chance of success.

Oily Hide (Ex): Hellstokers do

not secrete oil naturally, but their

constant contact with it leaves them

coated with a thick layer of the

substance at all times. This grants

hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to

Escape Artist checks (included in

the statistics block). The oil cannot

be washed off or removed.

Additionally, if a hellstoker is

hit with a fire effect, it bursts into

flames. See the hellstoker's fiery

body above for details.



#Devil, Xaphan (Duke) 53
Xaphan's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields,

are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction.

Fiery Aura (Su): As a free action, Xaphan can cause his

entire body to erupt in unholy fire (the same fires he uses to stoke

his furnaces). Creatures within 5 feet of or grappling Xaphan take

1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of unholy damage each

round. There is no save against either effect, but resistance to or

immunity to fire reduces or negates the fire damage.

Fiery Gaze (Su): A creature that meets Xaphan's gaze must

succeed on a DC 36 Will save or be affected as follows:

1st-round: The victim's blood begins to boil, dealing 3d6

points of fire damage this round; the victim takes a -2 circumstance

penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability and

skill checks, and saves. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire

damage but does not negate the penalties.

2nd-round: The victim's blood reaches searing temperatures

and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the circumstance

penalty increases to -4. Smoke rises from the victim's flesh. The

#54
victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round. A DC 37

Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the

penalties.

3rd-round: The victim's blood erupts into an inferno and

explodes from its body dealing 12d6 points of fire damage; the

victim is stunned for 3 rounds. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the

fire damage but the victim is still stunned.

A successful Will save renders a creature immune to Xaphan's

gaze for one day. The save DC against the gaze is Charisma-based

and the Fortitude saves are Constitution-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-animate dead, blasphemy (DC

27), detect magic, detect good, detect thoughts (DC 22), discern

location, fireball (DC 23 half), greater dispel magic, greater teleport

(self plus 50 pounds of objects only), improved invisibility (self

only), magic circle against good (DC 23), locate creature, polymorph

(self only), produce flame (DC 22), pyrotechnics (DC 22), resurrection,

scorching ray (3 rays), suggestion (DC 23), true seeing (DC 26),

unhallow, unholy aura (DC 28), wall of fire; 1/day-limited wish,

power word kill, symbol of fear (DC 26), symbol of weakness (DC

27). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Spells: Duke Xaphan casts arcane spells as a 20th-level

sorcerer. His spell list is below. The saves are Charisma-based.

Spells Known (Cast per Day 9/8/8/8/8/8/8/7/7/7; save DC 20 +

the banshee.

Summon Devils (Sp): Three times per day, Xaphan can

automatically summon 2 barbed devils, bone devils, or horned

devils, or 1d4 bearded devils or hellstokers, or he can attempt to

summon 1d2 pit fiends with an 80% chance of success.

Regeneration (Ex): Xaphan takes normal damage from

good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects

with the good descriptor.

Hellstorm: Hellstorm

is a Large +4 unholy

flaming burst

falchion.



#Draconid 55
Breath Weapon (Su): Each head can breathe a jet of fire once

every 1d4 rounds in a 30-foot line. A jet deals 3d6 points of fire

damage per head. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves the

damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Poison (Ex): A draconid delivers its poison with each successful

bite attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Draconid Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 21; initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Dexterity.

Web (Ex): A draconid can throw a web six times per day. This

is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50

feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against

targets up to one size category larger than the draconid. An

entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 21 Escape

Artist check or burst it with a DC 25 Strength check. Both are

standard actions. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and

the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.

Draconids often create sheets of sticky webbing 40 feet square.

They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can

also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must

succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they

stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web

attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus

if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while

pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 12 hit

points, and sheet webs have damage

reduction 5/-. Draconid webs have

fire resistance 5.

A draconid can move across its own

web at its climb speed and can pinpoint

the location of any creature touching

its web.

Skills: A draconid can always

take 10 on Climb checks, even if

rushed or threatened.



#Dragon, Dungeon 56
A dungeon dragon is

proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons and light

and medium armor and shields.

Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a dungeon

dragon can emit a blast of warm mist in a 100-foot line or 50-foot

cone. Creatures caught in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Will

save or be affected as if by a confusion spell for 1 minute. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Dominate Monster (Sp): Three times per day, a dungeon

dragon can generate an effect identical to a dominate monster

spell (caster level is equal to the dragon's HD). An affected

creature can make a DC 21 Will save to resist the effects. The save

DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.

A dungeon dragon uses this ability to populate its dungeon with

monsters it encounters in the surrounding terrain.

Change Shape (Su): At will, a dungeon dragon can polymorph

itself into any humanoid creature (as the polymorph spell, caster

level 15th). It never suffers disorientation as a result of this ability

and can remain in its humanoid form as long as it wishes.

Craft Crystal Ball (Su): No dungeon dragon is without its

crystal ball. The one thing dungeon dragon parents teach their

young is how to craft their own scrying crystals. Without this vital

piece of equipment, all of the dragon's labor is in vain. For the

purposes of constructing its own crystal ball, a dungeon dragon

automatically meets all the prerequisites-they are taught the

necessary skills and spells from birth. A dungeon dragon can only

innately create a basic crystal ball (see Wondrous Items in the

DMG). Those with an Intelligence score of 18 or higher often

create new crystal balls with additional powers.

Skills: Dungeon dragons have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and

Spot checks.



#Dragon, Smoke 57
Breath Weapon (Su): A smoke dragon's breath weapon

is a cone of thick, black smoke with a range of 20 feet. The

smoke cloud lasts 1d4 rounds before dispersing and can be

affected by wind. Creatures caught in the smoke must

succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save each round or spend that

round coughing and choking. A creature that chokes for 2

consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage

per 2 HD of the smoke dragon. Each round a creature spends

in the smoke, the save DC increases by +1. The save DC is

Constitution-based. The smoke obscures vision and gives

concealment (20% miss chance) to creatures within it.

Smoke dragons are immune to the choking effects of their

own breath weapon as well as the breath weapon of other

smoke dragons.

Smoke Form (Ex): Once per day, a smoke dragon can

assume a smoky form as a free action. It can spend up to 1

minute per day per HD in smoke form. A smoke form dragon

can fly at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). The

ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell.

Skills: *Due to their coloration, smoke dragons

gain a +4 racial bonus to Hide checks in areas of

smoke or dense fog.



#Dragonship 58
Breath Weapon (Su): Three times per day, a

dragonship can belch forth a gout of fire in a 30-foot

line that deals 10d6 points of fire damage. A successful

DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Fire Vulnerability: A dragonship takes half again

as much damage (+50%) as normal from fire, regardless

of whether a save is allowed, or if the save is a

success or failure.

Navigate (Ex): A captain merely has to whisper

into the ear of the dragon-head and make a Profession

(sailor) check (DC 15) to get the dragonship to

understand its course. A dragonship never gets lost

on an ocean voyage, and has a 50% chance of auto

#59
matically being aware of any safe coastline, seaside

towns and villages, and hidden ocean dangers such as

reefs and sandbars (it only knows of such dangers if

they are in the volume of sea charts used in its

creation).

Winds (Su): At will, a dragonship can cause winds

to fill its sails. This operates as the control winds spell

(caster level 10th) with the restriction that it can

only increase the wind's force for the purposes of

propulsion. The winds are generated from a point

beyond and slightly above the dragonship's stern. A

dragonship cannot use these winds to attack; their

sole purpose is propulsion.

Skills: A dragonship has a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid

a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim

check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use

the run action while swimming, provided it swims in

a straight line.



#Elusa Hound 60
Aura Tracking (Su): If an elusa hound has "tasted"

the magical aura of a living creature (a creature it has

successfully used its detect magic ability against or a

spell it has successfully detected that was cast by such

a creature), it gains a +10 competence bonus to its

Survival check when tracking that target. The aura

must be fresh ("tasted" within the last 3 hours) or the

elusa hound does not gain this bonus. This bonus

stacks with the racial bonus the hound receives for

tracking by scent (see below).

Detect Magic (Su): Elusa hounds can detect magic,

as the spell (caster level 6th). This ability is always

active and can be dispelled, but the creature can

restart it as a free action on its next turn.

Trip (Ex): An elusa hound that hits with a bite

attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check

modifier) as a free action without making a touch

attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the

attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip

the elusa hound.

Skills: *Elusa hounds receive a +4 racial bonus

to Survival checks when tracking by scent.



#Encephalon Gorger 61
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an

encephalon gorger must hit an opponent up to

one size larger than itself with a claw attack. It

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold that

deals claw damage each round and allows it to use

its mindfeed ability.

Mindfeed (Su): An encephalon gorger can suck

brain fluid from a living creature with its fangs by

making a successful grapple check. If it pins the

foe, it drains cerebral fluid, dealing 1d4 points of

Intelligence drain each round the pin is maintained.

On each successful attack, the encephalon

gorger gains 5 temporary hit points. At Intelligence

0, a grappled foe collapses, helpless and

unconscious in a coma-like stupor.

Adrenal Surge (Ex): Twice per day, an encephalon

gorger can create an effect on itself

identical to a haste spell (caster level 10th).

Fast Healing (Ex): An encephalon gorger heals

5 points of damage each round so long as it has at

least 1 hit point.

Mindsense (Su): An encephalon gorger can

gauge the relative intelligence level of any creature

within 60 feet. This ability can be dispelled,

but the encephalon gorger can restart it as a free

action on its next turn. The creature often uses

this power to locate the most intelligent creature

in a group, whom it then targets for capture (or a

meal).

Mind Screen (Ex): The mind of an encephalon

gorger is an alien and dangerous place. Should a

creature target an encephalon gorger with a mind-

affecting effect (charms, compulsions, phantasms,

patterns, and morale effects), telepathy, or psionic

mind-affecting effect or attack, it must succeed

on a DC 20 Will save or be driven permanently

insane (as by an insanity spell, caster level 15th).

The save DC is Intelligence-based.



#Fear Guard 63
Fear Aura (Su): A fear guard can radiate

a 20-foot radius fear aura as a free

action. A creature in the area must succeed

on a DC 16 Will save or be affected

as though by a fear spell (caster level

8th). A creature that successfully saves

cannot be affected again by the same

fear guard's aura for one day. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Spell-like Abilities: At will-ray of enfeeblement,

darkness; 2/day-deeper darkness. Caster level 8th.

Wisdom Damage (Su): The touch of a fear guard

deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to a living foe if

it fails a DC 16 Fortitude save. A creature reduced to

Wisdom 0 dies. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Create Spawn (Su): Any living creature reduced

to Wisdom 0 by a fear guard becomes a fear guard

under the control of its killer within 2d6 hours. If a

bless spell is cast on the corpse before this time, it

prevents the transformation.

Daylight Weakness (Ex): A fear guard exposed to

natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) suffers

2d6 points of damage and immediately flees from the

source of light. A fear guard caught in sunlight cannot

attack and can only take a single move or attack

action in a round.

See in Darkness (Su): A fear guard can see perfectly

in darkness of any kind, even that created by

deeper darkness spells.

Skills: *A fear guard has a +8 racial bonus on Hide

checks in areas of darkness.



#Fire Crab (lesser) 64
Heat (Ex): The body of a fire crab generates intense heat,

dealing 1d4 points of fire damage with its touch (1d8 points of fire damage for greater fire crabs). Creatures attacking a fire crab

unarmed or with natural weapons takes fire damage each time

their attacks hit. Any melee hit by a fire crab deals fire damage.

#65
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a fire crab must

hit an opponent up to one size smaller with a claw attack. It

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Constrict (Ex): A fire crab that gets a hold of an opponent of

its size or smaller automatically deals claw and fire damage each

round it maintains the hold.

Tremorsense (Ex): Fire crabs can automatically sense

the location of anything within 60 feet that is in

contact with the ground.

Skills: A fire crab has a +4 racial bonus on Hide and

Spot checks.

A fire crab has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check

to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can

always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if

distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.



#Fire Crab (greater) 64




#Fire Phantom 66
Fire (Ex): A fire phantom's fists are swathed in

elemental fire. Any melee hit deals fire damage.

Creatures attacking a fire phantom unarmed or

with natural weapons takes fire damage each time

their attacks hit.

Fire Blast (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard

action, a fire phantom can hurl a small globe of elemental

fire to a range of 30 feet (no range increment). By

making a successful ranged touch attack, it deals 2d6

points of fire damage. A creature hit must succeed on a

DC 15 Reflex save or catch on fire. The save DC is

Charisma-based. (See the DMG for more information

on catching on fire.)

Immolation (Su): Normally used as a last resort,

a fire phantom can detonate itself in an

inferno of elemental fire that deals 6d6 points of

fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.

A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the

damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This instantly kills the fire phantom if it fails a

DC 20 Will save. Even if the fire phantom survives,

its flames are extinguished for 1 minute.

During this time the fire phantom cannot use its

fire blast ability and does not deal fire damage

with its slam attack. It retains the fire subtype.

After 1 minute, its fires relight. If the fire phantom

survives the immolation, it may not use it

again for one day.

Rage (Ex): A fire phantom is in a constant state

of agony from the elemental fire that consumes its

body. Therefore, it is always in a berserk rage and

gains Str +4 and -2 AC (both already included in

the statistics block above). The fire phantom

cannot end this rage voluntarily and it cannot be

suppressed or negated.

Turn Immunity (Ex): A fire phantom cannot

be turned, rebuked, or commanded.



#Fire Whale (Burning Leviathan) 66
Scalding Blast (Su): As a full round action, a fire

whale can release a blast of superheated air from its

blowhole. This blast of air mixes with the cooler

(well, slightly cooler in the case of the planes of fire)

ambient air producing condensation that scalds or

burns those contacting it.

The blast from a fire whale is a cone 5 feet long per

two HD of the fire whale that deals 1d6 points of

damage per HD of the fire whale to all creatures

within the area. The resulting fallout covers a radius

equal to the length of the cone. A successful Reflex

save halves the damage.

Thus, a typical 12 HD fire whale releases a blow 30

feet long that covers a radius of 30 feet around it and

deals 12d6 points of damage. Affected creatures can

make a successful DC 22 Reflex save to halve the

damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Once a fire whale uses this ability, it must wait 1d4

rounds before using it again. After using this ability

four times, the fire whale must submerge for at least

two full rounds before it can use it again.

Blindsight (Ex): Fire whales "see" by emitting

high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures,

that allow them to locate objects and creatures

within 120 feet. A silence spell negates this and forces

the whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately

as good as a human's.

Hold Breath (Ex): A fire whale can hold its breath

for 8 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

Skills: A fire whale has a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid

a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim

check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use

the run action while swimming, provided it swims in

a straight line.

A fire whale has a +4 racial bonus to Spot and

Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if blindsight is

negated.



#Flea, Giant 68
Attach (Ex): If a giant flea hits with a touch

attack, it uses its many legs to attach itself to the

opponent's body. An attached flea is effectively grappling

its foe. The giant flea loses its Dexterity bonus

to AC and has an AC of 13. It gains a +12 racial

bonus to grapple checks while attached (already figured

into the Base Attack/Grapple entry).

An attached flea can be struck with a weapon or

grappled itself. To remove an attached giant flea

through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin

against the giant flea.

Blood Drain (Ex): A giant flea drains blood, dealing

1d3 points of Constitution damage in any round it

begins its turn attached to a victim. Once it has dealt

4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and leaps

away to digest the meal. At Constitution 0 the host

dies and the giant flea detaches. If it has yet to deal 4

points of Constitution damage, it seeks a new host.

Disease (Ex): About one in twenty giant fleas is a

disease carrier. Giant fleas can transmit any non-

supernatural disease from the DMG, though most

carry filth fever. The Fortitude save against a giant

flea's disease has a DC of 11 and is Constitution-

based.

Crowd (Ex): Because of their size and tactics, up

to four giant fleas can occupy the same 5-foot space.

Leap (Ex): Giant fleas are natural jumpers and

gain a +20 competence bonus on Jump checks.

Skills: Giant fleas can use their Strength or Dexterity

modifier on Jump checks, whichever is higher.



#Fulgurate Mushroom 69




#Fungoid 69
Skills: Fungoids gain a +4 racial bonus to Listen and

Spot checks. *In swampy or forested areas, fungoids +8

racial bonus to Hide checks.



#Fyr 71
Spell-Like Abilities: 4/day-mass charm animal

(this functions as charm animal, but allows the

fyr to charm up to 4 HD of animals) (DC 12); 3/

day-warp wood (DC 13); 1/day-pass without trace

(DC 12). Caster level 9th. The save DCs are

Charisma-based.

Weapon Attunement (Su): Fyrs have a mystical

ability to attune themselves with any weapon

they wield. A weapon held by a fyr functions as a

masterwork item (gaining a +1 bonus to attack

rolls) as long as the fyr wields it. This bonus does

not stack with the enhancement bonus gained

from magical weapons, or the bonus gained from a

masterwork weapon. This bonus is included in the

statistics block above.

Speak with Animals (Su): Fyrs can speak with

animals, as the spell (caster level 9th). This ability

is always active, but can be negated. A fyr can

restart it as a free action on its next turn.

Skills: Fyr have a +4 racial bonus on Handle

Animal checks. *Fyrs receive a +8 racial bonus on

Hide checks when in their natural environment.



#Gallows Tree 71
Create Gallows Tree Zombie (Su): When a creature

dies within 15 feet of a gallows tree, it uses a sharpened

tendril to slice open the creature's abdomen, thereby

spilling the corpse's innards on the ground. The organs

#72
and fluids are then absorbed by the tree's roots. Corpses

of a size other than Medium or Large are simply left to

rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish

pollen fired from one of the tree's branches. The abdominal

wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which

time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree zombie

connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that

created it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their

former abilities.

Gallows Tree Zombie (Ex): Each gallows tree has

several gallows tree zombies connected to it. A Huge

gallows tree may have no more than 7 gallows tree

zombies connected to it at one time. A Gargantuan

gallows tree can have a maximum of 11 zombies connected

to it at any given time. See the gallows tree

zombie entry in this book for details on that monster.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gallows

tree must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it

establishes a hold and deals slam damage each round

the hold is maintained.

Tremorsense (Ex): Gallows trees can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in

contact with the same vegetation the tree is touching.



#Gallows Tree Zombie 73
Spore Cloud (Ex): As a free action, once every 1d4

rounds (but no more than three times per day), a gallows

tree zombie can breathe a cloud of poisonous, greenish

spores in a 5-foot cube directly in front of it. A creature

caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save

or be slowed (as the slow spell) for 6 rounds. One minute

later, the creature must make another Fortitude save (same

DC) or take 1d3 points of Strength damage. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

Fast Healing (Ex): A gallows tree zombie heals

only if it is connected to its gallows tree by its tether-

vine.

Tether-Vine (Ex): A gallows tree zombie is connected

to the gallows tree that created it by a long,

sinewy vine. This vine can be lengthened to allow

the zombie to move up to 100 feet away from the tree.

The vine is AC 19 (touch 12) and has 10 hit points.

Harming the vine deals no damage to the gallows tree

zombie or the gallows tree, but if severed, does prevent

the zombie from using its fast healing ability.

Tremorsense (Ex): Gallows tree zombies can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60

feet that is in contact with

the same vegetation the

zombie is touching.



# Gelid Bettle Shared 74
Cold (Ex): A gelid beetle's body generates cold that deals extra

cold damage every time it succeeds on a bite attack (the exact

damage is listed in each monster's description). Creatures attacking

a gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this same

cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.

Skills: *Due to their coloration and affinity to attack from

ambush, gelid beetles have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in

their native environment.



#Gelid Beetle (lesser) 74
Cold (Ex): 1d4 points of cold damage.

Cold Spray (Ex): Once per day, a lesser gelid beetle can release

a spray in a 10-foot cone that deals 2d4 points of cold damage;

affected creatures that succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save take half

damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.



#Gelid Beetle (greater) 75
Cold (Ex): 1d8 points of cold damage.

Cold Cloud (Ex): Once per minute, as a free action, a greater

gelid beetle can emit a cloud of icy cold vapor in a 20-foot radius.

The cloud is extremely thick and prevents ranged weapon attacks

(except for magic rays) by those in the cloud. Further, melee attack

and damage rolls take a -2 penalty. Each round, on the beetle's

turn, the cloud deals 2d6 points of cold damage to each creature

within it. A DC 20 Fortitude save halves the damage. The cloud

lasts 1d4+3 rounds before dispersing and is not affected by wind.

The save DC is Constitution-based.



#Geon 75
Animate Boulders (Sp): A geon can animate rocks within 180

feet at will, controlling up to two rocks at a time. Boulders move

at a speed of 10 feet and fight as a geon in all respects. Animated

boulders lose their ability to move if the geon that animated them

is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise

similar to liveoak (caster level 15th), but affects rocks rather than

trees. Animated boulders have the same vulnerability to cold that

a geon has.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-stone shape; 1/day-move earth,

passwall, transmute rock to mud (DC 16), wall of stone (DC 16).

Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Freeze (Ex): A geon can hold itself so still it appears to be a

boulder. An observer must succeed on a DC 30 Spot check to

notice the geon is really alive.

Skills: *A geon has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks against

a background of stone or in rocky surroundings.



#Giant, Cave 76
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the cave

giant must hit an opponent up to two sizes smaller

with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity. If it wins the check, it establishes a

hold and can pound.

Pound (Ex): A cave giant that makes a successful

grapple check against a foe two or more sizes smaller

than itself can smash the opponent into the ground,

walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as a standard

action. This deals 2d6+12 points of bludgeoning

damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent

must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 24) or be

stunned for one round. A cave giant can perform this

action once per round as long as it maintains the

grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.

Trample (Ex): A cave giant can trample creatures

one category size smaller than itself as a standard

action that deals 2d6+12 points of crushing damage.

Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity

against the cave giant can attempt a Reflex save (DC

24) to halve the damage. The save DC is Strength-

based.

Oversized Weapon (Ex): A cave giant wields a

Gargantuan greatclub without penalty.

Cave Giants as Characters

Cave giant leaders are barbarians or adepts. Cave

giant clerics have access to two of the following

domains: Chaos, Earth, Trickery,

or War.



#Giant, Ferrous 77
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the ferrous

giant must hit an opponent up to two sizes

smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it

establishes a hold and can pound.

Pound (Ex): A ferrous giant that makes a successful

grapple check against a foe two or more sizes

smaller than itself can smash the opponent into the

ground, walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as

a standard action. This deals 2d6+22 points of blud

#78
geoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent

must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 37)

or be stunned for one round. A ferrous giant can

perform this action once per round as long as it

maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-

based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-heat metal (DC 14),

levitate (iron or steel objects or creatures only, including

itself); 1/day-wall of iron (DC 18). Caster

level 15th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Trample (Ex): A ferrous giant can trample creatures

one category size smaller than itself as a standard

action dealing 2d6+22 points of crushing damage.

Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity

against the ferrous giant can attempt a Reflex save

(DC 37) to halve the damage. The

save DC is Strength-based.

Ferrous Mind (Ex): Ferrous

giants are immune to mind-

influencing effects (charms,

compulsions, phantasms, patterns,

and morale effects).

Oversized Weapon (Ex): A

ferrous giant wields a Gargantuan

greatsword or greataxe

without penalty.



#Giant, Volcano 79
Breath Weapon (Su): Three times per day, a volcano

giant can exhale a cloud of warm and sulfuric

gas in a 30-foot cone. Affected creatures must make

a successful Fortitude save (DC 24) or take a -4

circumstance penalty on attack rolls, checks and

saves for 1 minute (10 rounds) due to fits of coughing

and choking. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Trample (Ex): A volcano giant can trample creatures

one category size smaller than itself as a standard

action that deals 2d6+16 points of crushing damage.

Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity

against the volcano giant can attempt a Reflex save

(DC 29) to halve the damage. The save DC is

Strength-based.

Rock Throwing (Ex): Adult volcano giants are

accomplished rock throwers and receive a +1 racial

bonus to attack rolls when throwing rocks. A volcano

giant can hurl rocks of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium

objects). A volcano giant's thrown rocks have a

range increment of 110 feet. As a full-attack action

a volcano can reach into an open source of flowing

lava, pull out a semi-solidified blob of molten rock,

and throw it. Such a missile deals normal rock damage

plus an extra 1d6 points of fire damage per round

for 1d4+1 rounds if it hits.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A volcano giant is immune to

fire attacks. It takes half again as much (+50%)

damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a

save is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

Oversized Weapon (Ex): A volcano giant wields a

Gargantuan two-handed longspear without penalty.

Rock Catching (Ex): A volcano giant can catch Small,

Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).

Once per round, a giant that would normally be hit by a rock

can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC

is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a

Large one. (If the projectile has a magical bonus to attack,

the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready

for and aware of the attack.

Stone Shape (Sp): Once per day, a volcano giant

can create an effect identical to a stone shape spell

(caster level 17th).

#80


#Gloom Crawler 81
Constrict (Ex): A gloom crawler deals 1d6+7 points of

damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gloom crawler

must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

All-Around Vision (Ex): Each of the gloom crawler's

tentacles has a single small eye near the tip. This grants the

gloom crawler a +4 racial bonus to Search and Spot checks

and it cannot be flanked.

Tremorsense (Ex): A gloom crawler can automatically

detect the location of anything within 60 feet that is in

contact with the ground.

Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex): A gloom crawler is highly

susceptible to natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), and

takes 2 points of Constitution damage each round it remains in the

area. While operating in natural sunlight, it can only take a single

move action or attack action each round.



#Golem, Furnace 82
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a

furnace golem can belch forth a line of fire 5 feet

wide, 5 feet high, and 50 feet long; 10d6 points of fire

damage, Reflex DC 22 for half. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Heat (Ex): A furnace golem's entire form is extremely

hot. Any slam attack deals fire damage.

Creatures attacking a furnace golem unarmed or with

natural weapons take this same fire damage each

time one of their attacks hits.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the furnace

golem must hit an opponent at least one size category

smaller than itself with a slam attack. It can them attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it can

conduct the grapple normally or shove an opponent up to

two sizes smaller into its furnace-interior the following

round.

Furnace-Interior (Ex): A furnace golem can try to

shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself

into its interior by making a successful grapple check. An

opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped

as a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round.

A trapped creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire

damage each round. Escaping the creature's interior requires

a successful Strength check (DC 30) to bend

the bars. Alternately a trapped creature can

escape by dealing at least

25 points of damage to

the bars (AC 22).

#83
Note, the golem's damage reduction applies to all attacks

against the bars.

A Huge furnace golem's interior can hold 2 Medium, 8

Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures.

Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-influencing

effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,

patterns, and morale effects), poison, sleep, paralysis,

stunning, death effects, necromancy effects, and polymorph.

Immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude

save (unless it works on objects, or is harmless). Not

subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability

damage, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death

from massive damage; cannot be healed, raised or

resurrected, though it can be repaired.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A furnace golem is

immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows

spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects

function differently against the creature, as

noted below.

A magical attack that bypasses its cold resistance slows

a furnace golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no

saving throw.

A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow

effect on the furnace golem and heals 1 point of damage for

each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If

the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full

normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

Rustproof (Ex): Though constructed of iron, a furnace

golem, unlike an iron golem, is not affected by rust attacks.



#Golem, Iron Maiden 83
Animated Host (Su): Once a victim trapped within

an iron maiden has died, it reanimates as a zombie in

the next round (as if by an animate dead spell). It

cannot escape, however, and serves only to fuel the

iron maiden and provide it with skills and abilities.

While it is trapped, the zombie cannot be attacked,

damaged, turned, rebuked, or commanded, and it

doesn't suffer any damage from the bladed lid. If the

lid of the golem is somehow forced open, the zombie

has the normal abilities of a Medium zombie (as

detailed in the MM). The victim of an iron maiden

golem must be alive when it is placed inside and the

lid is closed or the golem's animate host ability fails.

Bladed Lid (Ex): A living creature inside an iron

maiden when the lid is closed is pierced by twenty

dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of

#84
piercing damage each round. The lid automatically

seals with an arcane lock spell with a caster level

equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator

(14th level usually). The lid can be forced open with

a successful Strength check (DC 34) or by casting

dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on the lid.

The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +10

bonus from the arcane lock spell.

Because of the shape of the iron maiden, only a

Medium humanoid can be sealed inside.

Steal Essence (Su): An iron maiden golem that

has created a host using its animate host ability (see

above) gains 10

temporary hit

points, uses its

own base attack

bonus or the host's

(whichever i s

higher), and can make

normal use of the victim's

skills, feats, and non-magical

class abilities.

The golem must substitute

its own ability scores when

determining its total skill bonuses;

therefore it cannot

use skills requiring Constitution

or Intelligence, and

since it cannot speak,

many Charisma skills

are severely limited.

Likewise, the iron

maiden golem must

meet the requirements

for any feat

in order to make

use of that feat

(thus feats such

as Dodge and

Combat Expertise

are unavailable to

the golem). An iron maiden cannot use any

divine spells or divinely granted special abilities,

since the host within is no longer able to

receive such abilities from her deity. An iron

maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as

its inherent magic immunity disrupts any attempt

to do so.

Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-

influencing effects (charms, compulsions,

phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), poison,

sleep, paralysis, stunning, death effects,

necromancy effects, and polymorph. Immune to

any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless it

works on objects, or is harmless). Not subject to

critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, energy

drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive

damage; cannot be healed, raised or resurrected,

though it can be repaired.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): An iron maiden golem is

immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows

spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects

function differently against the creature, as

noted below.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage

slows an iron maiden golem (as the slow

spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving

throw.

A magical attack that deals fire

damage breaks any slow effect on

the iron maiden golem and heals

1 point of damage for each 3

points of damage the attack

would otherwise deal. If

the amount of healing

would cause the golem

to exceed its full normal

hit points, it gains

any excess as temporary

hit points.

Rust Vulnerability

(Ex): An iron maiden

golem is affected normally

by rust attacks,

such as that of a rust monster

or a rusting grasp spell.



#Golem, Magnesium 85
Aura of Sickness (Su): As a free action,

a magnesium golem can generate

an aura in a 10-foot radius spread

that sickens all living creatures entering

the area for 1d4 minutes if that

creature fails a Fortitude save (DC 15). A

creature that successfully saves cannot be affected

again by the same magnesium golem's aura of sickness

for one day. A delay poison or neutralize poison

spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.

Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected

and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal

bonus on their saves. The save DC i s

Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Dexterity Damage (Su): A magnesium golem's

slam attack deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage to

a living foe if it fails a Fortitude save (DC 13). A

creature reduced to Dexterity 0 by a magnesium

golem is paralyzed. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-influencing

effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,

patterns, and morale effects), poison, sleep, paralysis,

stunning, death effects, necromancy

effects, and polymorph.

Immune to any effect that requires

a Fortitude save (unless

it works on objects, or is

harmless). Not subject to

critical hits, nonlethal damage,

ability damage, energy

drain, fatigue, exhaustion,

or death from massive

damage; cannot be

healed, raised or resurrected,

though it

can be repaired.

Immunity to

Magic (Ex): A

magnesium golem

is immune to any

spell or spell-like ability

that allows spell

resistance. In addition, certain

spells and effects

function differently

against the creature as

noted below.

A magic attack

that deals water

damage or creates

water slows a magnesium

golem (As

the slow spell) for

3 rounds, with no

saving throw.

A magical effect

that deals fire damage

breaks any

#86
slow effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of

damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of

healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit

points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A

magnesium golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.

Rust Vulnerability (Ex): A magnesium golem is affected

normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a

rusting grasp spell.



#Golem, Ooze 87
Acid (Ex): An ooze golem's body secretes a deadly acid

that damages only flesh. Any melee hit deals acid damage.

Creatures attacking an ooze golem unarmed or with natural

attacks take acid damage as though hit by the ooze golem's

slam attack.

Death Throes (Ex): When an ooze golem is reduced to

0 or less hit points its body collapses into a bubbling pool of

acidic slime that covers a 10-foot square area. Creatures

touching this acidic pool take 2d6 points of acid damage (no

save) for 1d3 rounds. The acid pool remains for 10 rounds

(1 minute) before dispersing.

Amorphous (Ex): An ooze golem has no clear front or

back; therefore, it cannot be flanked.

Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-influencing

effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and

morale effects), poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, death

effects, necromancy effects, and polymorph. Immune to any

effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless it works on

objects, or is harmless). Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal

damage, ability damage, energy drain, fatigue,

exhaustion, or death from massive damage; cannot be

healed, raised or resurrected, though it can be repaired.

Fast Healing (Ex): An ooze golem heals 5 points of

damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.



#Golem, Rope 88
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a rope golem must hit

an opponent up to one size larger than itself with a slam attack. It

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,

it establishes a hold and can strangle its opponent.

Strangulation (Ex): A rope golem deals 1d8+3 points of

damage with a successful grapple check. Because the rope golem

seizes the opponent by the neck, a strangled foe cannot speak or

cast spells with verbal components.

Construct Traits (Ex): Immune to mind-influencing effects

(charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects),

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, death effects, necromancy effects,

and polymorph. Immune to any effect that requires a

Fortitude save (unless it works on objects, or is harmless). Not

subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, energy

drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage; cannot

be healed, raised or resurrected, though it can be repaired.

Fire Vulnerability (Ex): A rope golem takes half again as much

(+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a save

is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A rope golem is immune to any spell

or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain

spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted

below.

A disintegrate spell affects it normally. A rope trick or animate rope

spell deals 1d6 points of damage to the rope golem per three levels

of the spell caster (e.g., a 6th-level sorcerer deals 2d6 points of

damage to a rope golem if it casts rope trick or animate rope). A

mending spell heals the rope golem of 2d6 points of damage. Fire-

based effects and spells affect it as described in its fire vulnerability

above.



#Grave Risen 89
Animate Dead (Sp): Once per day, a grave risen can

animate dead, as the spell (caster level 5th).

Blood Poisoning (Ex): A creature hit by a claw attack

must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract

blood poisoning. This deals 1 point of Constitution

damage to the victim per minute until the victim dies or

the blood poisoning is healed. A neutralize poison or

remove disease spell rids the victim of blood poisoning, as

does a DC 15 Heal check. Multiple wounds to the same

foe do not result in multiple instances of blood poisoning.

The save DC and check DC are both Charisma-based.



#Grimstalker (Banaan) 90
Poison (Ex): Grimstalkers deliver poison with each successful

claw attack.

Grimstalker Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 14; initial and secondary

damage 1d6 points of Dexterity damage.

A grimstalker often coats its weapons with this poison. In such

a case, the poison lasts for 1 minute or until it is touched or scores

a successful hit. The grimstalker may coat a single weapon with

poison as a standard action.

Sneak Attack (Ex): When a grimstalker flanks an opponent,

or anytime an opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, it

deals an extra 3d6 points of damage with a successful attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day-control plants (DC 21), tree

shape. Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Skills: *Grimstalkers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks

while in forested terrain.

A grimstalker can always take 10 on a Climb check, even

if rushed or threatened.



#Gutslug 90
Blood Drain (Ex): A gutslug that grapples a foe drains blood.

This deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the grapple

is maintained. Once a gutslug has drained 8 points, it detaches and

moves away to digest its meal.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a gutslug must hit an

opponent of any size with its bite attack. It can then attempt a

grapple check as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold

and drains blood.

Sneak Attack (Ex): When a gutslug flanks

an opponent, or anytime an opponent is denied

its Dexterity bonus to AC, the gutslug

deals an extra 2d6 points of damage with a

successful attack.

Blindsight (Ex): A gutslug has no visual

organs but can ascertain all foes within 30

feet using scent, sound, and vibration.

Vulnerabilities (Ex): Gutslugs are vulnerable

to salt. A pint of salt deals 1d4

points of damage to a gutslug each round

for 1d2 rounds. A pint of alcohol poured or

thrown on a gutslug deals no damage but

causes it to take a -4 penalty on grapple

checks for 1 minute.



#Hanged Man 91
Drag (Ex): If a hanged man hits with its rope

attack, the rope latches onto the opponent's body.

This deals no damage but drags the opponent 10 feet

closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack

of opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which

requires a DC 18 Escape Artist check or a DC 14

Strength check. The check DCs are Strength-based,

and the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial bonus.

A hanged man can draw in a creature within 5 feet of

itself and attack with both claws with a +4 attack

bonus in the same round.

Rope (Su): The rope of a

hanged man is about 30 feet

long and can lash forward

20 feet or upward 10 feet

to grab a victim and

drag it closer to the

hanged man (see its

drag ability, above).

The rope has AC 22,

hardness 10, and 10 hit

points, and it has damage

reduction 5/

slashing. If the hanged

man's rope is severed

(by reducing it to 0 or

less hit points), both the

rope and the hanged man

are destroyed. Upon the

hanged man's destruction,

the rope crumbles

to dust.

Skills: *Using its

animated rope, a

hanged man has a +10

racial bonus on Climb

checks. Hanged men have a

+6 racial bonus on Use Rope

checks.





#Helix Moth (larva) 92
Acid (Ex): Helix moths constantly regurgitate

acid to aid in digestion. The bite attack of a helix

moth deals acid damage (1d6 larval) on a successful melee attack.

#93
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a

larva must hit with its bite attack. It can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it

establishes a hold and deals bite and acid

damage each round the hold is maintained.

Blindsense (Ex): A larva helix moth has

no visual organs but can ascertain prey within

60 feet by scent and sound.



#Helix Moth (adult) 93
Acid (Ex): Helix moths constantly regurgitate

acid to aid in digestion. The bite attack of a helix

moth deals acid damage (1d6 larval, 1d8 adult

stage) on a successful melee attack.



Drone (Ex): The rapid beating of the helix

moth's wings creates a droning sound,

audible up to 60 feet away, that clouds the

minds of all who hear it. Affected creatures

take a -4 circumstance penalty on attack

rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill

checks for the next 1 minute if they fail a DC

21 Will save. A creature that makes a successful

Will save is unaffected by the droning

of the same helix moth for one day. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Droning is a free action as long as the helix

moth is airborne. On the ground, it can beat

its wings as a move action with the effects as

above.

Poison (Ex): An adult helix moth delivers

a highly toxic poison with a successful sting.

The save is Constitution-based.

Adult Helix Moth Poison: Injury, Fortitude

DC 21 negates, initial and secondary damage

1d10 Strength.

Tremorsense (Ex): Adult stage hel ix

moths can automatically sense the location

of anything within 60 feet that is in contact

with the ground.



#Hoar Spirit 94
Cold (Ex): Hoar spirits generate intense cold. Any

melee hit deals cold damage. Creatures attacking the

hoar spirit unarmed or with natural weapons suffer

cold damage each time their attacks hit.

Cone of Cold (Sp): Once per day, a hoar spirit can

produce an effect similar to a cone of cold spell. The

cone is 30 feet long and deals 3d6 points of cold

damage to creatures caught within the area. A successful

DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage. The

save DC is Charisma-based.

Glaciation (Su): A creature hit by a hoar spirit's

claw must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be

overcome with bone-numbing cold that paralyzes

the opponent for 1d4+1 rounds and deals 1 point of

Dexterity damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Sense Heat (Su): Hoar spirits can detect heat

(such as that generated by living creatures) in a 60-

foot radius. This includes the heat given off by

invisible creatures. This ability can be stopped or

started by the hoar spirit as a free action. This ability

functions as a detect evil spell (caster level 7th)

except there is no chance the

hoar spirit is stunned and it is

not blocked by stone, wood,

or other material.



#Hornet, Giant 95
Poison (Ex): A giant hornet's poison is delivered

with each successful sting. The save DC is Constitution-

based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Giant Hornet Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 21 negates;

initial and secondary damage 1d8 points of

Dexterity damage.

Pheromone (Ex): The first time a creature successfully

hits a giant hornet, it releases a pheromone

that heightens the aggressiveness of all giant hornets

in the area. All giant hornets within 50 feet gain a +1

morale bonus on attack rolls for the remainder of the

encounter and fight without penalty even while disabled

or dying (see the PHB).

Skills: Giant hornets have a +8 racial bonus on

Spot checks. *They also have a+4 racial bonus on

Survival checks to orient themselves.



#Huggermugger 96
Confusion Aura (Su): A group of three or more huggermuggers

can, as a free action, create an aura of confusion. Anyone within 40

feet of the huggermuggers must succeed on a Will save (DC 12, +1

per huggermugger in the group) or be affected as by a confusion spell

for 5 rounds. All huggermuggers in the group must be within 30

feet of each other to create this aura. Each huggermugger may

contribute to the confusion aura once per day. A creature that

makes a successful save cannot be affected by the confusion aura

of any huggermuggers in that group for one day. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Natural Cunning (Ex): Huggermuggers possess innate cunning

and logical ability. This makes them immune to maze spells,

prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track

enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.



#Inphidian, Cobra-Back 98
Poison (Ex): A cobra-back delivers a debilitating poison with

a successful bite from its snake-hands. The save is Constitution-

based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Cobra-back Inphidian Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 16 negates,

initial damage 1d4 Strength, secondary damage 1d4 Strength.

Spit Poison (Ex): A cobra-back can spit a line of poison from

its mouth to a range of 20 feet. This stream deals poison damage

as above (same Fortitude save to resist) and can be used once every

1d4 rounds.



#Inphidian, Common 99
Blinding Spray (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a

common inphidian can spew forth a line of milky-

white liquid that causes blindness (as the blindness

spell) for 6 rounds to any creature struck. A Reflex

save (DC 14) negates the effects. The spray has a

range of 20 feet.

Poison (Ex): A common inphidian delivers a debilitating

poison with a successful bite from its

snake-hands. The save is Constitution-based.

Common Inphidian Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 14

negates, initial damage 1d4 Strength, secondary damage

1d4 Strength.



#Inphidian, Dancer 100
Entrancing Dance (Su): A charmer inphidian can

sway its body in a rhythmic motion that charms all

those within 30 feet viewing the dance. The charmer

makes a Perform (dance) check. Those viewing the

dance must make a successful Will save (DC equal to

the charmer's Perform check) or be fascinated for

1d4+2 rounds. A fascinated creature can take no

actions other than defending itself. If attacked or

threatened, the fascinated creature receives a new

Will save with a +4 circumstance bonus (same DC).

A creature that makes a successful save is immune to

the entrancing dance of that charmer for one day.

Poison (Ex): A charmer delivers a debilitating poison

with a successful bite from its snake-hands. The save is

Constitution-based.

#101
Charmer Inphidian Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 14 negates,

initial damage 1d4 Strength, secondary damage 1d4

Strength.



#Kathlin 102
Great Endurance (Ex): A kathlin gains a +4 bonus to

Constitution checks made to continue running (see run, in the

PHB). This bonus stacks with the bonus to Constitution checks

the kathlin gains from the Endurance feat.



#Lizard, Cavern 102
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the cavern

lizard must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and deals bite damage each round the hold is maintained.

Skills: A cavern lizard can always choose to

take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or

threatened.

Cavern lizards have a +4 racial bonus

on Hide and Move Silently

checks. *In areas of natural

stone or rock, the Hide

bonus increases to +8.



#Magmoid 103
Burn (Ex): The body of a magmoid is composed of

molten rock and elemental fire. Any melee hit deals

2d6 points of fire damage initially and 1d6 points of

damage for the next 1d3 rounds. Creatures attacking

a magmoid unarmed or with natural weapons take

fire damage each time one of their attacks hits just as

if the magmoid had hit with a melee attack.

Fiery Aura (Ex): Anyone within 10 feet of a

magmoid must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or

sustain 1d6 points of fire damage from the intense

heat. A new save must be made each round a creature

remains in the area. Treat this effect as an emanation

centered on the magmoid. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Magma Blast (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a

magmoid can shoot a blast of molten rock at an

opponent within 40 feet. This deals 3d6 points of fire

damage in the round it hits (Reflex save DC 17 for

half), and half that amount (3d6 / 2) for the next 1d3

rounds (no save).

Melt Weapons (Ex): Any metal weapon that strikes

a magmoid must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save

or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Blindsight (Ex): A magmoid's body is covered

with small receptacles that allow it to ascertain prey

by sound and vibration to a range of 60 feet.



#Mawler 104
Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a mawler deals

automatic bite damage each round the hold is maintained.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a mawler must hit an

opponent up to two sizes larger with its bite attack. It can then

attempt a grapple check as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can constrict. A mawler being worn as an article of

clothing has a +4 racial bonus to grapple checks.

Vorpal Bite (Ex): A mawler that scores a critical hit with its

bite attack while being worn severs the extremity that was inside

it at the time. For example, a mawler being worn as a boot severs

the victim's leg. A mawler can only use its vorpal bite while being

worn.

A creature that loses a limb suffers a -4 penalty to skill checks

that require the use of two limbs. For example, a victim that loses

a hand or arm suffers a -4 penalty to Climb checks, Disable Device

checks, and so forth. Further, a creature that loses its primary

weapon-wielding arm or hand suffers a -6 penalty when wielding

a weapon in its offhand. A creature with the Two-Weapon

Fighting feat that loses its primary arm or hand

ignores the penalty for wielding a weapon in

its offhand.

If the victim loses a foot or leg, the

penalty applies to Balance checks, Jump

checks, and the like. Additionally,

the creature's speed is reduced to

one-quarter. If the severed

extremity happens to be

the head, the victim

dies immediately (unless

it can live without

its head).

Magic Aura (Su): A

mawler continuously

emits a moderate aura of

Transmutation magic. This ability

can be negated or dispelled,

but the mawler can activate it as a

free action on its next turn.

Mimic Shape (Ex): A mawler

can assume the general shape of any

object that is roughly Tiny size. A

mawler's body is fleshy and pliable, but

it can alter the rigidity of its body to resemble

metal, wood, and even stone. Most

mawlers have found that taking on the shape of

articles of clothing provides the most ready

meals. The ruse can be detected by a Spot

check opposed by the mawler's Disguise skill.

Skills: A mawler has a +8 racial bonus on

Disguise checks.



#Mimi 105
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-invisibility; 2/day-frost fingers

(as burning hands, but fires a sheet of ice that deals cold damage)

(DC 13). Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Once per day, a mimi can use a cone of cold (DC 17). Caster level

4th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A group of three or more mimis together can use Otluke's

freezing sphere (DC 18), once per day. Caster level 12th. The save

DCs are Charisma-based.

Lower Temperature (Su): A mimi can, as a free action, lower

the temperature in a 10-foot radius around its body by 20-80

degrees. Creatures in the area that are not immune or resistant to

cold may take damage as detailed in the DMG (see environmental

hazards and conditions).

Skills: Mimis have a +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and

Listen checks.



#Murder-born 106
Charisma Damage (Su): A murder-born causes 1d4

points of Charisma drain each time it hits with its incorporeal

touch attack. On each such attack, it gains 5 temporary

hit points. At Charisma 0, a creature dies.

Despondent Wail (Su): Twice per day, as a standard

action, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail. Any

living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must

succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural

feelings of hopelessness. An affected creature suffers

a -10% penalty to all XP earned from this point forward

until the curse is removed. A remove curse or break enchantment

(requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell),

limited wish, wish, or miracle breaks the curse, but XP "lost"

while this curse is in effect are not regained. Whether or not

the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again

by the same murder-born's despondent wail for one day.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Sense Living (Su): A murder-born can detect living

creatures within 100 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight

ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically,

as if it had cast deathwatch.

Unnatural Aura (Su): Both wild and domesticated

animals can sense the unnatural presence of a murder-born

at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach

nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain

panicked as long as they are within that range.



#Niln (Vapor Horror) 107
Drench (Ex): The niln's touch puts out torches,

campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames

of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel

magic (caster level equals the niln's HD).

Drowning Fog (Su): Once per day, a niln can

create a muggy, vaporous cloud centered on its form.

The cloud lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds) before

dispersing, but otherwise functions as a fog cloud

spell.

The muggy vapors fill the lungs of any creature in

the area with water. A creature that takes only a

move action can hold its breath for 2 rounds per

point of Constitution; a creature that takes any action

other than a move action can hold its breath for

1 round per point of Constitution. After that, refer to

the rules for drowning (see the DMG).

Vapor Form (Ex): A niln's natural form is similar

to a gaseous form spell, except it retains is natural AC

bonus, can make attacks and use its supernatural

abilities, and has a fly speed of 60 feet (maneuverability

perfect). The niln is not subject to the effects

of wind.



#Nuckalavee 108
Augmented Critical (Ex): A nuckalavee threatens a

critical on a natural 19-20 with a hoof or bite. A successful

critical hit deals triple damage.

Breath Weapon (Su): As a free action, once every 4

rounds, a nuckalavee can breathe a cloud of noxious gas from

its equine head in a 20-foot cone that liquefies the organs of

those in the area. This cloud lasts one round before dispersing

and deals 6d6 points of damage to all creatures in the area. An

affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to halve

the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#109
Horrific Appearance (Su): Creatures viewing the grotesque

form of a nuckalavee must succeed on a DC 17

Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of Strength damage. The

damage cannot reduce a victim's Strength score below 0,

but anyone reduced to Strength 0 is helpless. Creatures that

are affected by this power or that successfully save against it

cannot be affected again by the same nuckalavee's horrific

appearance for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Nuckalavees are not affected by the horrific appearance of

other nuckalavees.

Trample (Ex): As a full-round action, a nuckalavee can

move up to twice its speed and literally run over any

opponents of Medium size or smaller. The nuckalavee

merely has to move over the opponents in its path; any

creature whose space is completely covered by the

nuckalavee's space is subject to the trample attack. If a

target's space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered

trampled if the nuckalavee moves over all the squares it

occupies. If the nuckalavee moves over only some of a

target's space, the target can make an attack of opportunity

against the nuckalavee at a -4 penalty. A nuckalavee that

accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space returns to

the last legal position it occupied, or the closest legal

position, if there's a legal position that's closer. A nuckalavee

deals 1d6+7 points of bludgeoning damage with its trample

attack. A nuckalavee can only deal trampling damage to

each target once per round, no matter how many times its

movement takes it over a target creature. Trampled opponents

can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a

-4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of opportunity,

trampled opponents can attempt DC 20 Reflex saves to take

half damage. The save DC is Strength-based.



#Oakman 109
Shillelagh (Su): Any oaken club or staff wielded by an

oakman automatically gains the benefits of the shillelagh

spell (caster level 5th). This benefit is already included in

the statistics block above and only functions for an oakman.

Moss (Ex): Using its unique knowledge of plants and

herbal mixtures, an oakman can concoct unusual cakes

from tree moss. A typical oakman has 1d6 moss cakes of

random type on

#110
his person. These moss cakes have a variety of effects and

must be eaten by the target creature to take effect. Saves

(where applicable) have a DC of 15.

Ability Score Damage: The victim takes 1d6 points of damage

to a random ability score (determined when the moss cake is

created). One day after eating the moss cake, if the victim doesn't

receive a restoration spell, it must make another successful save or

one point of ability damage is actually permanent drain.

Coloration: This moss cake is quite harmless when eaten

and does nothing more than cause the victim's skin to

become spotted. The spots can be of just about any color,

though most tend to be brown, red, or blue. The spots last

for 1 hour before fading.

Healing: This moss cake heals the target as by a heal spell

(caster level 5th).

Lethargy: The victim becomes sluggish if it fails a Fortitude

save. The effects last for 30 minutes. While affected, the victim

moves at one-half its normal speed and takes a -2 circumstance

penalty to AC and on attack rolls, checks, and saves.

Pain: Eating this moss cake wracks the victim with pain

for 1d4 hours if it fails a Fortitude save. During this time, the

victim takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls,

weapon damage rolls, and ability and skill checks.

Poison: Eating this moss cake poisons the victim (ingestion,

Fortitude DC 15 negates, initial damage 1d6

Constitution, secondary damage 2d6 Constitution).

Sleep: This moss cake puts the victim to sleep for 1 hour

(as the sleep spell) if it fails a Will save.

Tree Dependent (Su): Each oakman is mystically bound

to a single enormous oak tree and must never stray more

than 1 mile from it. Any who do become ill and die within

4d6 hours. An oakman's oak does not radiate magic.

Tree Stride (Su): At will, an oakman can create an effect

identical to that of the tree stride spell (caster level 5th).

Oakmen can only travel through oak trees.

Skills: Oakmen have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if

rushed or threatened.



#Ogren 110
Ogre Blood (Ex): Fifty percent of ogren have

enough ogre blood in their veins to qualify as ogres.

Those that qualify are considered ogres for all special

abilities and effects.

Skills: Ogrens have a +2 racial bonus on Move

Silently checks.



#Oil Shark 112
Blindsense (Ex): An oil shark can locate creatures underwater

(including under the oily seas of its elemental lair) within a 30-

foot radius. This ability works only when the oil shark is underwater

(or under oil).

Keen Scent (Ex): An oil shark can notice creatures by scent in

a 180-foot radius and detect blood in oil or water at ranges of up

to one mile.

Skills: Oil sharks have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.

Additionally, due to the oily secretions of their metallic scales,

oil sharks have a +10 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks.

An oil shark has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose

to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It

can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a

straight line.

*Their oily hides also allow them to glide smoothly and quickly

through normal water. In such an environment, an oil shark gains

a +10 racial bonus on Swim checks.



#Phantasm 113
Energy Drain (Su): The incorporeal

touch of a phantasm deals

one negative level. The Fortitude save

to remove a negative level has a DC of

22. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such

negative level bestowed, the phantasm gains 5 temporary

hit points.

Possession (Su): Once per round, a phantasm can merge

its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability

is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 9th), except that

it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the

phantasm must try move into the target's space; moving

into the target's space to use this ability does not provoke

attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with

a successful DC 17 Will save. A creature that successfully

saves is immune to that same phantasm's possession for one

day, and the phantasm cannot enter the target's space. If the

save fails, the phantasm vanishes into the target's body.

A phantasm automatically deals one negative level (from

its energy drain ability) each round to its host. The host can

eject the phantasm with a successful DC 17 Will save. This

save can be attempted once per round. If successful, the

phantasm is forced from the host's body and it cannot

attempt to posses the same host for 1 minute.

If turned or subjected to a dismissal spell while

possessing a host, the phantasm is ejected. The save

DCs are Charisma-based.

Aura of Desecration (Su): A phantasm has a continuous

aura of desecration that affects a 10-foot radius. This aura

can be dispelled, but the phantasm can restart it again as a

free action on its next turn. All turn attempts made within

the aura suffer a -3 profane penalty;

all undead within or entering

the aura gain a +1

profane bonus to attack

rolls, damage

rolls, and

saves (these

bonuses are

already included in the

phantasm's statistics block).

This spell otherwise functions

as a desecrate spell.

Unnatural Aura

(Su): Both wild and domesticated

animals

can sense the unnatural

presence

of a phantasm

at a distance of

30 feet. They

will not willingly

approach

nearer than

that and panic

if forced to do

s o ; they remain

panicked

as long as they

are within

that range.



#Phlogiston 114
Fire Bolt (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a phlogiston

bush can release a tiny bolt of fire at a single opponent

within 40 feet (no range increment). The bolt

deals 2d6 points of fire damage to a creature struck.

The opponent can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to

halve the damage. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a

phlogiston bush deals automatic tendril damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a

phlogiston bush must hit with a tendril attack. It can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the

grapple check, the phlogiston bush establishes a hold

and can constrict.

Death Throes (Ex): If a phlogiston bush is reduced

to 0 or less hit points, it explodes in a concussive

blast of fire that deals 4d6 points of fire damage to all

creatures in a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 14

Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Blindsight (Ex): Phlogiston bushes have no visual

organs but can ascertain all foes within 60 feet through

sound and vibrations.



#Piercer 33




#Proscriber 115
Condemn (Su): Once per day, by making a successful

melee touch attack, a proscriber can sever the

connection between a divine caster and his or her

deity. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save

or lose the ability to cast divine spells, turn or rebuke

undead, smite good or evil, and use any other divine-

based spell, spell-like abilities, or supernatural

abilities. On a successful save, the target takes 10d6

points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Further, one that fails its save resists all beneficial

divine spells (such as heal, or any cure spell) cast on

him or her. A creature attempting to cast a beneficial

divine spell on a condemned creature must succeed

on a DC 20 caster level check.

The effects of this ability are permanent but can be

removed by the casting of a remove curse spell followed

by an atonement spell. The one casting the

remove curse and atonement spells must be a divine

caster who worships the same god as the condemned

and who is of a class level equal to or higher than the

condemned.

#116
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-continual flame, discern

lies (DC 19); 3/day-discern location, power word

stun; 1/day-blade barrier (DC 21), geas/quest, plane

shift (DC 22), polymorph (self only), power word blind,

waves of exhaustion, word of recall. Caster level 15th.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Spells: Proscribers cast divine spells as 15th-level

clerics. A proscriber has access to any two domains

its deity has access to. The save DCs are Wisdom-

based.

#Pudding, Blood 117
Disgorge (Ex): A blood pudding that has infused

itself can force the creature's own blood out through

its pores, eyes, ears, and mouth. This is a standard

action that deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage

each round. At Constitution 0, the host dies, and the

blood pudding exits. To onlookers it appears as if the

slain creature is bleeding profusely.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a blood

pudding must hit an opponent up to its size with a

slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can infuse its form with its opponent. A

blood pudding gains a +4 racial bonus to grapple

checks because of the sticky slime its form secretes.

Infuse (Ex): A blood pudding that makes a successful

grapple check can merge its form with that of

a living creature. If it succeeds, the blood pudding's

form disappears as it soaks through skin, wounds, and

any other opening in the host's body. This special

attack deals no damage but allows the blood pudding

to use its disgorge special attack.

A creature infused with a blood pudding can try to

forcibly eject the creature once per round as a full-

round action (coughing it up, vomiting, and so on).

This requires a successful DC 17 Fortitude save. The

save DC is Constitution-based. A creature can be

affected by the pudding's infuse attack again, but

gains a +2 conditional bonus on its Fortitude save.

This bonus lasts for one day and is effective against

the infuse attack of that blood pudding only.

Amorphous (Ex): Blood puddings have no

discernable front or back and are not subject to

critical hits. They cannot be flanked.

Blindsight (Ex): A blood pudding's entire body is

a sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and

vibration within 60 feet.

Vulnerabilities (Ex): Drinking liquid with high

alcohol content weakens a blood pudding and reduces

further Constitution damage by one-half for

the next 10 minutes.

Consuming pure vinegar causes an infused blood

pudding to eject itself in the same round the vinegar

is consumed. A creature drinking pure vinegar must

succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated

for 3 rounds. A blood pudding does not infuse itself

again with this creature for one day.



#Pudding, Stone 118
Acid (Ex): A stone pudding

secretes a digestive acid

that dissolves organic material

and stone, but not

metal. Any melee attack deals

acid damage. Clothing dissolves

and becomes useless immediately unless

it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. A stone or

wooden weapon that strikes a stone pudding dissolves

immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save.

The save DCs are Constitution-based.

The pudding's acidic touch deals 21 points of damage

per round to wooden or stone objects (including creatures

it has turned to stone), but the pudding must

remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal

this damage.

Petrification (Ex): The touch of a stone pudding

turns an opponent permanently to stone if it fails a DC

21 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Blindsight (Ex): A stone pudding's entire body is a

primitive sensory organ that allows it to ascertain prey

by scent and vibration within 60 feet.

Camouflage (Ex): It takes a DC 20 Spot check to

notice a non-moving stone pudding before it attacks.

Anyone with ranks in Survival or Craft (stonemasonry)

can use one of those skills instead of Spot to notice the

creature. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice a

stone pudding.

Vulnerability (Ex): A stone pudding is slowed (as by

a slow spell) for 3 rounds if stone to flesh is cast on it. The

stone pudding does not receive a save against this effect.

Skills: A stone pudding can always choose to take 10

on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.



#Quasi-Elemental, Acid 120
Acid (Ex): Acid quasi-elementals are living creatures of

acid; any melee hit deals acid damage. Creatures hitting an acid

quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid

damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack.

Drench (Ex): The quasi-elemental's touch puts out

torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames

of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The

creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level

equals the quasi-elemental's HD).

Fumes (Ex): The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body

act as an inhalant poison. Creatures within 5 feet of an acid

quasi-elemental must succeed on a Fortitude save each round or

suffer 1 point of Constitution damage. One minute later another

Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 1d4

points of Constitution damage. The save DC is Constitution-

based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.

Skills: An acid quasi-elemental has a +8 racial bonus on

any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check,

even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.



#Quasi-Elemental, Obsidian 124
Death Throes (Ex): When reduced to 0 or less

hit points, an obsidian quasi-elemental explodes

in a cloud of razor-sharp bits of obsidian. A creature

caught in the area can make a Reflex save for

half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for

each elemental's death throes.

Molten Glass (Ex): A successful hit against an obsidian

quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon

(or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage

equal to the quasi-elemental's current HD opens a

wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for

1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a

Reflex save or take fire damage from the splash. A new

save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a

creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-

based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.



#Rakklethorn Toad 124
Poison (Ex): A rakklethorn toad deals poison with its

thorns. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Rakklethorn Toad Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 13; initial

and secondary damage 1d6 Dexterity.

If a rakkelthorn toad is killed or subdued before it has fired

all of its thorns in a given day, the poison can be extracted

from its remaining thorns. A successful DC 16 Heal or DC

16 Craft (alchemy) check allows the poison to be changed

into a mild anesthetic; one rakkelthorn toad provides

enough for one dose. A single dose of this anesthetic,

applied to the wound of an injured creature, provides a +2

circumstance bonus to Heal checks (multiple doses do not

stack). This bonus lasts for one hour, after which time the

anesthesia wears off. Poison cannot be extracted from

thorns that have been fired by the rakklethorn.

Thorns (Ex): From its back, a rakklethorn toad can fire

a volley of thorns once per round as a standard action. All

thorns in the cluster either hit or miss their target and deal

1d6 points of damage plus poison (see above). This attack

has a range of 50 feet with no range increment. The

rakklethorn toad can launch a total of 6 such volleys per day.

Skills: *In areas of tall grass or dense undergrowth, a

rakklethorn toad has a +6 racial bonus on Hide checks.



#Rat, Barrow 125
Stone Skin (Su): Once per day, as a standard

action, a barrow rat can toughen its skin to the

hardness of stone. It gains damage reduction 5/- for

1 minute.

Swarm (Ex): Barrow rats crawl over each other in

an attempt to swarm an opponent. Up to four barrow

rats can occupy a single 5-foot space.

Skills: Barrow rats have a +4 racial bonus

on Hide and Move Silently checks and a +8

racial bonus on Balance checks. They use

their Dexterity modifier for Climb checks.

A barrow rat can always take 10 on a

Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.



#Red Jester 126
Fear Cackle (Su): A red jester can unleash a fear-inducing

cackle as a free action. Anyone within 60 feet that hears it must

succeed on a DC 22 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds.

Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is

immune to the same red jester's fear cackle for one day. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Jester's Deck (Su): The red jester uses a deck of playing cards

in combat that functions as a deck of many things (see the DMG).

Once per round, as a standard action, the red jester can draw a

single card and throw it at an opponent to a range of 20 feet. This

requires a successful ranged touch attack. If successful, the card

takes effect that round and affects the target just as if he had drawn

a card from a deck of many things. A red jester can draw the same

card more than once. The playing cards only function in the hands

of a red jester. To anyone else, they are merely normal playing

cards.

Merriment (Su): If a red jester strikes an opponent with its

mace, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or fall to

the ground laughing for 1d3 rounds. The opponent is not helpless,

but cannot take any action. A mace of merriment functions only in

the hands of a red jester. In the hands of any other creature it

functions as a masterwork light mace.

Unassailable Mind (Ex): Anyone targeting a red jester with a

thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability must

succeed on a DC 20 Will save or suffer the effects of an insanity spell

(caster level 15th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Skills: A red jester has a +4 racial bonus on Perform (comedy)

checks.



#Redcap 127
Poison (Ex): Redcaps often employ special poisons

extracted from aconite plants. Aconite poison is

crafted by redcaps so they always carry a generous

supply with them.

Aconite Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 15; initial

and secondary damage 1d4 Constitution.

A redcap often coats its weapons with this poison.

In such a case, the poison lasts for 1 minute or until

it is touched or scores a successful hit. The redcap

may coat a single weapon with poison as a standard

action.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-invisibility; 1/day-

dancing lights, detect good, glitterdust (DC 14), mirror

image, ventriloquism (DC 13). Caster level 7th. The

save DCs are Charisma-based.

Skills: Redcaps have a +2 racial bonus on

Listen and Spot checks.

*Redcaps have a +4

racial bonus on Hide

checks in a forest

setting.



#Renzer (Devilfin) 128
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a renzer must

hit an opponent up to one size larger with its bite attack. It

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it establishes a hold and deals bite damage each

round the hold is maintained.

Command Fish (Su): Twice per day, a renzer can command

fish and aquatic creatures as the mass charm spell

(caster level 8th). The renzer can communicate with any

creature it currently commands as if by speak with animals.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will-control water, water breathing

(others only); 2/day-cone of cold (DC 17 half) (can be

action or avoid a hazard.

It can always choose

to take 10 on a Swim

check, even if distracted

or endangered. It can use

the run action while swimming,

provided it swims

in a straight line.



#Retch Hound 129
Breath Weapon (Su): Once per minute, a retch

hound can belch forth digestive juices in a 10-foot

cone. Affected creatures take 2d6 points of acid

damage and are nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A successful

DC 13 Reflex save halves the acid damage and

prevents the nausea. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Stench (Ex): All living creatures (except other

retch hounds) within 30 feet of a retch hound must

succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for

10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures

that successfully save cannot be affected by the

same retch hound's stench for 24 hours. A delay

poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect

from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity

to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to

poison receive their normal bonus on their saving

throws.

Trip (Ex): A retch hound that hits with a bite

attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check

modifier) as a free action without making a touch

attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the

attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the

retch hound.

Skills: Because of its multiple eyes, a retch hound

has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.

Retch hounds have a +4 racial bonus on Survival

checks when tracking by scent.



#Riptide Horror 130
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a riptide horror must

hit with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins

the grapple check, it establishes a hold.

tentacle attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Riptide Horror Poison: Contact, Fortitude DC 18; initial damage

1d8 Dexterity, secondary damage paralysis 1d4 rounds.

water with ease.

Blindsight (Ex): A riptide horror has no visual organs but can

ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.

Spider Climb (Sp): At will, a riptide horror can create an effect

identical to a spider climb spell (caster level 6th).

Vulnerable to Electricity (Ex): The riptide horror takes half

again as much damage (+50%) as normal from electricity,

regardless of whether a save is allowed, or if the save is a success or

failure.

Skills: *A riptide horror receives a +10 racial bonus to Hide

checks in murky water.

A riptide horror has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose

to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It

can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a

straight line.

Silently and Spot checks.

control.

Artist checks.



#Sabrewing 135

a critical on a natural 19-20 with a wing

slash. A successful critical hit deals triple damage.

Lasting Wound (Su): A wound caused by a

sabrewing's wing slash does not heal naturally

and resists healing spells. A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or heal spell on a creature

damaged by the sabrewing's wing slash must succeed

on a DC 18 caster level check, or the spell

has no effect on the injured character. The check

DC is Constitution-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day-magic weapon,

align weapon; 1/day-greater magic weapon. Caster

level 8th.

The sabrewing can use its spell-like abilities on

its wings.

See Invisible (Su): Sabrewings have a continuous

see invisibility ability, as the spell (caster

level 8th).



#Sand Kraken 136
Camouflage (Ex): Because it remains buried until it attacks,

it takes a successful Spot check (DC 20) to detect the presence

of a sand kraken before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival

or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Spot

to notice the sand kraken.

Constrict (Ex): A sand kraken deals 1d6+5 points of damage

with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the sand kraken

must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It can

then attempt a grapple check as a free action without provoking

an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a hold and can constrict or bite an opponent each round

the hold is maintained. A sand kraken gains a +4 racial bonus to

grapple checks which is already included in its statistics block.

Tentacles (Ex): The only part of a sand kraken that is

normally exposed is its tentacles. A single tentacle is AC 20

(touch 14) and has 15 hit points. The loss of a tentacle does not

harm the sand kraken (i.e., damage done to a tentacle does not

count against its total hit points). Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4

days.

Tremorsense (Ex): A sand kraken can automatically sense

the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the

ground.



#Sand Stalker 137
Attraction (Ex): The sand stalker's front four legs

are hollow. When a gust of air or wind blows across

them, they create a hypnotic sound that captivates

all creatures within a 100-foot spread that fail a DC

15 Will save. This is a sonic, mind-affecting charm

effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be

affected again by the same sand stalker's attraction

for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A captivated victim walks toward the sand stalker,

taking the most direct route possible. If the path

leads into a dangerous area, (fire, over a cliff, and so

on), that creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated

creatures can take no actions other than to

defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sand

stalker stands there and offers no resistance to the

monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as

the sand stalker's legs are subjected to wind. A bard's

countersong ability allows the entranced creature to

attempt a new Will save.

Poison (Ex): A sand stalker delivers a highly toxic

poison with a successful bite attack. The save is

Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.

Sand Stalker Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 19 negates,

initial damage is paralysis for 1d4+1 rounds.

Secondary damage is 1 point of Strength damage

each round the victim is paralyzed.

Tremorsense (Ex): Sand stalkers can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60 feet

that is in contact with the ground.

Hide checks, a +6 racial bonus on Jump checks, and

a +8 racial bonus on Spot

checks. *In sandy areas,

the Hide bonus increases

to +8.



#Screaming Skull (Cacophony Golem) 138
Cacophony (Su): When a living creature

comes within 40 feet of a screaming

skull, it releases an ear-shattering roar of

tumultuous sounds as a free action that

can be heard up to 1,000 feet away.

Affected creatures within 60 feet must

succeed on a DC 13 Will save or take 1d6

points of sonic damage each round until

they leave the area. Spellcasters within the

area must succeed on a Concentration check

(DC 10 + sonic damage taken) to successfully cast a

spell. The screaming lasts 1d4 rounds before ceasing

for one round. After that, the skull remains silent

unless a creature moves within 40 feet of it-it then

screams again and repeats the above cycle. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

This cacophonous scream increases the chance of

wandering monsters by +20%, who come to investigate

the source of the disturbance.

Insanity (Su): An opponent that touches a screaming

skull (including with natural or unarmed attacks)

must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be stricken

insane as by an insanity spell (caster level 6th). The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Magic Missile (Su): Once per round, a screaming

skull can produce a magic missile from its eyes, as the

spell (caster level 6th). The screaming skull can

release 3 missiles each round using this ability, and

(unlike the spell) an opponent can attempt a DC 13

Reflex save to avoid a missile. The save DC is Constitution-

based.
