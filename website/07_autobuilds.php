        <h1>PCGen Autobuild site</h1>
        <p>Autobuilds are compilations of the PCGen program and data taken direct from our source at regular 
        intervals. They are not manually tested at all prior to upload, but are instead an excellent tool to 
        allow people to test what we are currently working on. As a result, unless you like living on the edge, 
        it is best to use one of our regular releases available from the 
        <a href="http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/03_get_pcgen.php">downloads page</a> .</p>
        
        <h2>PCGen Development Autobuilds (6.01.x)</h2>
        <p>These are regular scheduled builds from the development branch (trunk) of PCGen. Every night, 
        the project is checked for changes and if any have been made a new build is generated.</p>
